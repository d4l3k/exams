True/False
For each true/false question below provide a brief justification of your answer.
6. A Software Requirements Specification fully documents how a software system will be
built. [2 marks]

7. The design principles we learned in class are only relevant if you are using the waterfall
lifecycle. [2 marks]

8. A disadvantage of the waterfall lifecycle is that it’s difficult to get the requirements
correct, and the rest of the project will be built on the (potentially faulty) requirements.
The staged delivery model does not have this disadvantage. [2 marks]

9. The intent of the Abstract Factory design pattern is to allow the creation of different types
of related objects without having to rely on the concrete classes. [2 marks]

12. Use one of the design patterns from the appendix to draw a class diagram for the
following system. You should not use the stereotype names (ie, the class names shown in
the UML diagram in the appendix). Instead, choose class names that are appropriate for
this situation. You only need to include the classes that demonstrate how the design
pattern is used.
You are creating new user interface widgets (eg, text boxes, windows, buttons, and
panels to contain other widgets). Some of the widgets will need to scroll horizontally,
some will need to scroll vertically, and some will need both. [6 marks]

project with somewhat unknown requirements.
a. What would you say to your technical team lead to convince him or her that you
should use an agile methodology? [4 marks]

b. Even after hearing your arguments (from part a), your technical team lead is hesitant to
completely adopt an agile methodology (eg, XP or Scrum) but he/she is willing to try
some agile practices. Which two agile practices would you suggest your team adopt
first and why? [4 marks]
