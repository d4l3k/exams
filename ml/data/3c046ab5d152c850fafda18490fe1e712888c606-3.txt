for each of your answers.

[3] c. What is the main advantage of RandomizedQuickSelect over Select1?

[3] d. Dijkstra’s algorithm associates a cost with each vertex v that has not yet been
added to the tree it constructs. What does this cost represent?

[3] e. Why does the Gale-Shapley (Stable Matching) algorithm discussed in class
terminate after at most n2 iterations?

[3] f. When do we use amortized analysis?

[9] 3. A Computer Science researcher has designed a new data structure called a sheap
that supports operations insert, findMinMax and extractMinMax, and decides to
use amortized analysis to determine the worst-case running time of a sequence of n
operations on an initially empty sheap. She defines a potential function Φ for sheaps,
such that Φ(S) ≥ 0 for every sheap S, and such that Φ(S) = 0 if the sheap S is
empty. After analyzing the running time of the three operations, she has learned
that
• An insert operation on a sheap with n elements takes time log n, and increases
the sheap’s potential by 2.
√
• A findMinMax operation on a sheap with n elements takes time x + n, where
x is the number of elements examined by the operation. The potential of the
sheap goes down by x − 1.

• A extractMinMax operation starts by performing a findMinMax operation. The
remainder of the extractMinMax operation takes time log n, and decreases the
sheap’s potential by 1.

Give as tight a bound as possible on the worst-case running time of a sequence of n
operations on an initially empty sheap.

[9] 4. For each of the following recurrence relations, determine whether or not the Master
Theorem discussed in class can be used. If it can be used, apply it to derive the
solution of the recurrence relation using O notation. If the Master Theorem can not
be used, explain why briefly.

[5] 5. Write a recurrence relation that describes the running time of the following algorithm as a function of n. Algorithm DoSomethingConstant runs in Θ(1) time, and
algorithm DoSomethingLinear runs in Θ(N ) time,
Algorithm MysteryP(A, N, n)
//
// A is an array with N element, n is a value between 0 and N.
//
if (n = 0) then
DoSomethingLinear(A, N)
else
For i ← n-1 downto 0 do
DoSomethingConstant(A, n, i)
MysteryP(A, N, n-1)
DoSomethingConstant(A, n, i)

You may treat N as a constant.

Draw the data structure after each of the following operations have been performed
sequentially (that is, part (b) starts from the data structure you drew as your answer
to part (a), etc). If a subtree remains the same from one step to the next, you can
draw its root and write same underneath instead of redrawing the whole subtree.

[15] 8. The CEO of a software company wants to keep his developers happy by giving them
a bonus, but does not want to spend too much money. He thus wants to select as
few developers as possible (these will get a bonus, and be happy), chosen so that
every other developer likes at least one of those that get a bonus (and hence will be
happy for him/her).
The CEO’s problem can be modeled using a graph G = (V, E): each node in the
graph is a developer, and an edge (u, v) means that developer u likes developer v.
The CEO is looking for a minimum subset W of the set V of vertices, where for
every vertex u ∈
/ W , there is an edge (u, w) where w ∈ W . This is called a minimum
dominating set for the graph G.
[9] a. Write a greedy algorithm that finds a subset W of V (it does need to be
the subset with the fewest elements possible) with that property. Your mark
will depend in part on the criterion you use to decide which vertex to add to
W . You do not need to give pseudo-code, but you should indicate what data
structure you are using to store the vertices that your algorithm has not dealt
with yet.

[3] b. What is the running time of the algorithm you described in part (a)?

[3] c. The minimum dominating set problem does not satisfy the greedy choice property. Knowing this, what can you conclude about the algorithm you gave in
part (a)?

[17] 9. Anne and Simon have been arguing about where to have lunch after the CPSC 320
final examination, and decide to solve the decision by playing a sequence of Poker
games. The first person to win n games gets to choose where they will have lunch.
Anne is a slighly better poker player, and has a 51% chance of winning any individual
Poker game.
Let P (i, j) be the probability that Anne will be the first person to win n games,
given that she only needs to win another i games (that is, Anne has won n − i games
so far), and that Simon only needs to win another j games (that is, he has won n − j
games so far). It can be proved that
P (i, j) = 0.49P (i − 1, j) + 0.51P (i, j − 1)

(1)

Anne is worried about his chances of winning, and asks you to use dynamic programming to compute the probability P (n, n) that she will win n games before Simon
does.
[3] a. State how big a table you need to answer Anne’s question using dynamic
programming, and the meaning of each entry in the table.

[3] b. Give one possible order that you can use to compute the entries in the table
from part (a).

[3] c. List all of the base cases that will be needed when you are computing the
entries in the table from part (a). That is, list the cases where you can not use
equation (1) to compute P (i, j), and the value of P (i, j) for each of them.

[8] d. Write pseudo-code for an algorithm that uses dynamic programming to determine the probability that Anne will win n Poker games before Simon does.
