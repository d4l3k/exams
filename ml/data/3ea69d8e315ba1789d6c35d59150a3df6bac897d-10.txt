[1] 1. Do you want your tutorial attendance to count towards your grade?
If you answered ‘YES’, then 1% of your final course mark will be based on your tutorial attendance (# attended divided by total number minus 2, but no more than full credit). Online
quizzes will be worth 5%. If you answered ‘NO’, then tutorial attendance is worth nothing
in your mark, and online quizzes count for 6% of your final course mark.
[6] 2. Short Answers
[3] a. Recall the arithmetic and logic unit from lab #4:

This circuit can not compute the OR of its two inputs (i.e. aluA ∨ aluB). Describe
briefly the changes you would need to make to the circuit to add the OR function to
it. You are not allowed to remove one of the functions it currently computes to make
room for OR.
Solution : You would need to (1) add an OR gate connected to the inputs aluA and
aluB, (2) modify the two multiplexers to have 8 inputs (instead of 4) and a 3-bit
select input (instead of a 2-bit select input), and (3) increase the width of the
function input to 3 bits from 2.
The modified ALU is shown below:

[3] b. How could you determine if the following is a valid rule of inference, knowing that
it can not be proved by applying the rules listed on the lectures slides and/or in Epp ?
(p → q) ∧ (r → s)
p∨r
∴q∨s
Solution : You could verify that the proposition ((p → q) ∧ (r → s) ∧ (p ∨ r)) →
(q ∨ s) is a tautology using a truth table.
[9] 3. Consider the following circuit:

[3] a. Write an unsimplified boolean algebraic expression for the output of this circuit.
Solution : The unsimplified boolean expression corresponding to the circuit is
x : ∼ (∼ (p ∧ ∼ q) ∧ ∼ (q ∧ r)) ∨ r
[4] b. Using a sequence of logical equivalences, simplify this expression as much as possible.
Solution :
x ≡ (∼∼ (p ∧ ∼ q) ∨ ∼∼ (q ∧ r)) ∨ r

by DeMorgan’s law

≡ ((p ∧ ∼ q) ∨ (q ∧ r)) ∨ r

by the double negative law

≡ (p ∧ ∼ q) ∨ ((q ∧ r) ∨ r)

by the associative law

≡ (p ∧ ∼ q) ∨ r

by the absorption law

[2] c. Finally, draw the circuit corresponding to the simplified expression. Hint: you should
only need three gates.
Solution :

[11] 4. A political sciences major is studying the political deeds (and misdeeds) before an election
in the country of Borduria. He learns the following facts:
• Either Syldavia is a much nicer country to visit than Borduria, or the bordurian secret
police planted stolen art in someone’s bedroom.
• If colonel Sponsz had a rival thrown in jail on a fake charge, then the bordurian secret
police planted stolen art in someone’s bedroom.
• Marshal Pleksy-gladz is proud of his facial hair, and either colonel Sponsz had a rival
thrown in jail on a fake charge or general Tapioca likes bananas.
• If Boris is a friend of the king of Syldavia, then colonel Sponsz did not have a rival
thrown in jail on a fake charge and general Tapioca does not like bananas.
• If Syldavia is not a much nicer country to visit than Borduria, then either Boris is a
friend of the king of Syldavia or colonel Sponsz did not have a rival thrown in jail on
a fake charge.
• Either colonel Sponsz had a rival thrown in jail on a fake charge or Boris is a friend of
the king of Syldavia.
Note: Syldavia is a country that borders Borduria.
[3] (a) Rewrite each of these statements using propositional logic. Make sure to define the
propositions you are using (that is, state something like: “s: Syldavia is a much
nicer country to visit than Borduria.’ before writing the proposition ∼s). You can
abbreviate these (e.g. “s: Syldavia is a . . . Borduria”) if you wish.
Solution : We will use the following propositions (I have ordered them alphabetically, but there was no need for you to do that):
b
c
g
m
p
s

Boris is a friend of the king of Syldavia.
Colonel Sponsz had a rival thrown in jail on a fake charge.
General Tapioca likes bananas.
Marshal Pleksy-gladz is proud of his facial hair.
The bordurian secret police planted stolen art in someone’s bedroom.
Syldavia is a much nicer country to visit than Borduria.

Given that, the statements can be rewritten as:
1. s ∨ p
2. c → p
3. m ∧ (c ∨ g)
4. b → (∼ c ∧ ∼ g)
5. ∼ s → (b ∨ ∼ c)
6. c ∨ b
[8] (b) Using your answer from part (a), known logical equivalences, and the rules of inference, prove that Syldavia is a much nicer country to visit than Borduria (note: there
is additional space at the top of the next page).

[6] 5. The Ant-el 9099 CPU uses 9 bit integers and represents signed integers using two’s complement.
[2] a. What sequence of bits would the Ant-el 9099 CPU use to represent
the integer −215? Hint: 215 = 128 + 64 + 16 + 4 + 2 + 1.
Solution : Since 21510 = 0110101112 , it follows that −21510 =
1001010002 + 1 = 100101001.
[2] b. The Ant-el then adds −80 to your answer from part (a). Knowing
that −8010 = 1101100002 , what will be the decimal value of the
sum ?
Solution : The sum is 100101001 + 110110000 = 011011001 in
binary, which is 128 + 64 + 16 + 8 + 1 = 217.
[2] c. Why is the sum of these two negative integers on the Ant-el 9099
positive?
Solution : It is negative because −215 − 80 = −295, which is
outside the range of values that can be represented with a 9-bit
signed integer (−256 . . . 255).
[6] 6. Given the following definitions:
• P : the set of people.
• C: the set of the kinds of creatures.
• Likes(x, y): person x likes creature y.
• AfraidOf(x, y): person x is afraid of creature y.
translate each of the following English statements into predicate logic. For instance, the
statement “Paul likes dogs” would be translated as Likes(P aul, dogs).
[3] a. One or more people are afraid of ghosts and witches, but are not afraid of (and like)
black cats.
Solution : ∃p ∈ P, AfraidOf(p, ghosts) ∧ AfraidOf(p, witches) ∧ ∼ AfraidOf(p, black cats)∧
Likes(p, black cats).
[3] b. People do not like creatures they are afraid of.
Solution : ∀p ∈ P, ∀c ∈ C, Afraid(p, c) →∼ Likes(p, c)

page 6
[3] 7. Using the same definitions as in the previous question, translate
∀p ∈ P, ∀q ∈ P, ∃c ∈ C, Likes(p, c) ∧ Likes(q, c)
into English.
Solution : Any two people have a creature that they both like in common.
[8] 8. Design a circuit that takes as input a four bit unsigned integer b3 b2 b1 b0 and outputs the
integer part of its square root as a two bit unsigned integer x1 x0 . For instance, if the input
was 4, then the output would be 2, and if the input was 8 then the output would also be 2.
Hint: think about the outputs individually; your circuit should not attempt to “compute” the
square root mathematically!
Solution : We start by writing out the truth table for the circuit:

We can then observe the following patterns:
• Output x1 is 1 whenever the input is greater than or equal to 4. That is, x1 is 1 when
either b3 is 1, or b2 is 1 (or both).
• Output x0 is 1 when the input is either less than 4 (but not 0), or larger than 8. The
first condition can be written as ∼ b3 ∧ ∼ b2 ∧ (b1 ∨ b0 ), while the second condition
can be expressed as b3 ∧ (b2 ∨ b1 ∨ b0 ).
These give us the following circuit:
