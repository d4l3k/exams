[9] 1. Short Answers
[2] a. What kind of proof is the following (note: part of the proof is missing and has been
replaced by . . . ) ?
Consider an unspecified positive integer a. Suppose that the cube root of a
is a rational number, but not an integer. This means that . . . And therefore
the cube root of a is irrational.
Solution : This is a proof by contradiction: we start by making an assumption (the
cube root of a is a rational number, but not an integer) and finish by concluding the
opposite.
[3] b. Consider the following statement:
∀x ∈ Z, ∃y ∈ Z, Q(x, y)
Can a proof that starts with “Choose y = 3.” be valid? Explain why or why not.
Solution : Yes: it is possible (but not likely) that the value y = 3 will work for
every possible integer x. That is, maybe Q(x, 3) is true for every x ∈ Z. We could
of course have chosen a different value of y for each x (and in fact in most cases we
would need to do that), but it’s not required.
[4] c. You are asked to write a direct proof to show that the statement ∃x ∈ D, ∃y ∈
D, P (x, y) is false. What would your proof look like? Write as much of the proof as
you can, given that we did not tell you what P (x, y) is.
Solution : We want to prove that this statement is false, or equivalently that its negation
∀x ∈ D, ∀y ∈ D, P (x, y)
is true. Hence our proof would start with “Consider unspecified elements x, y of
the domain D (where x may or may not equal y)”. We would then try to show that
P (x, y) is false.
[7] 2. Consider the following deterministic finite-state automaton, whose inputs are words written
using uppercase letters (A through Z) only. The word “else” on an edge denotes every letter
that does not appear on any other edge leaving from the same node as that edge (for instance,
the word “else” on the edge that joins the leftmost node to itself is the same as “D, E, F, . . . ,
Y, Z”).

[3] b. Describe as simply as you can the set of words that this finite-state automaton accepts.
Solution : It accepts words that contain at most one A, at most one B, and where
every C is immediately followed by a T .

[12] 3. For each of the following inferences, first state if it’s valid or invalid, and then justify your
answer briefly. Assume that a is an element of domain D.

[3] a.

∃x ∈ D, P (x) → Q(x)
∼ Q(a)
∴ ∼ P (a)
Solution : This inference is invalid. Simply because the implication P (x) → Q(x)
is true for one or more elements of the domain D, it does not mean that it is true for
a (it could, for instance, be true for every element except a!). Since the implication
P (a) → Q(a) may not be true, knowing ∼ Q(a) does not give us any information
about P (a).

[3] b.

∀x ∈ D, P (x) → Q(x)
∼ Q(a)
∴ ∼ P (a)
Solution : This inference is valid: we can first use universal instantiation on the first
premise to deduce that P (a) → Q(a), and then since we know ∼ Q(a) it follows
from modus tollens that ∼ P (a).

[3] c.

∃y ∈ D(∃x ∈ D, P (x, y)) → Q(y)
∀z ∈ D, P (z, a)
∴ Q(a)
Solution : This inference is invalid: suppose we have D = {0, 1, . . . , 10}, with
Q(y) : y = 0 and P (x, y) : x ≤ y and a = 10.
• The first premise is valid: choose y = 0. Then Q(y) holds, which means that
any implication with Q(y) as its right-hand side will be true.
• The second premise is valid: z ≤ a for every element of the domain (because a
is the largest element of the domain).
However the conclusion 10 = 0 is clearly wrong.

[3] d.

∀x ∈ D, ∼ ∀y ∈ D, P (x, y) → Q(x, y)
∴ ∀x ∈ D, ∃y ∈ D, P (x, y)∧ ∼ Q(x, y)
Solution : This inference is valid: we simply applied the generalized DeMorgan’s
law to the premise to get
∀x ∈ D, ∃y ∈ D, ∼ (P (x, y) → Q(x, y)),

page 4
used the definition of → to get
∀x ∈ D, ∃y ∈ D, ∼ (∼ P (x, y) ∨ Q(x, y)),
and finally applied the DeMorgan’s and double negative laws to obtain the desired
conclusion.
[10] 4. For each of the two following theorems, first translate the theorem into predicate logic, and
then prove it using a proof technique of your choice.
a. It is possible to find a pair of integers whose sum and difference are both perfect
squares.
Solution : Translated into predicate logic, this is ∃a ∈ Z, ∃b ∈ Z, PerfectSquare(a +
b) ∧ PerfectSquare(a − b).
To prove this statement, we only need to choose two integers a and b and to verify that
a + b and a − b are perfect squares. There were many possible pairs: in fact given any
two perfect squares x, y that are either both even or both odd, and assuming without
loss of generality that x ≤ y, the two integers a = (y + x)/2 and b = (y − x)/2 would
work (the sum is y, the difference is x).
This aside, all you needed to write was something like: “Choose a = b = 0. Then
a + b = 0 = 02 and a − b = 0 = 02 . Hence both a + b and a − b are perfect squares.”
b. If a, b and c are positive integers, and ac divides bc, then a divides b.
Solution : Translated into predicate logic, this is ∀a ∈ Z+ , ∀b ∈ Z+ , ∀c ∈ Z+ , ac |
bc → a | b (recall that a | b means “a divides b”).
To prove this, consider three unspecified positive integers a, b, c. Assume that ac
divides bc. Hence bc = (ac)x for some integer x. Since c is positive, we can divide
both sides of the equality by c, and hence b = ax. Thus a divides b.
[6] 5. One of your teaching assistants designed a circuit to count the number of distinct sequences
of consecutive 1 bits in a multi-bit input (the next bit of the input is available every time the
clock ticks). For instance, the output of the circuit should be
• 1 if the input was 11100,
• 2 if the input was 0111101,
• 3 if the input was 10010010,
etc. Unfortunately a crazy Computer Science instructor armed with an eraser came by! Help
the teaching assistant by restoring the gate(s) and/or wire(s) the instructor has deleted, to get
a working circuit.

[6] 6. Using a proof by contradiction, prove that for all positive integers a and b, (a+b)/2 ≥
Hints: (1) you should square both sides of an inequality, (2) what is (a − b)2 ?

√
ab.

Solution : We use a proof by contradiction (as stated in the question!).
Consider two
√
unspecified
positive integers a, b, and assume that (a + b)/2 < ab. Because (a + b)/2
√
and ab are both positive, this means that


a+b
2

2

√
< ( ab)2

and hence
a2 + 2ab + b2
< ab

page 6
or stated otherwise
a2 + 2ab + b2 < 4ab.
However, by substracting 4ab from both sides of the inequality, this means that
a2 − 2ab + b2 < 0
which is the same as stating that
(a − b)2 < 0
which
is impossible (squares of integers can not be negative). Consequently (a + b)/2 ≥
√
ab.
