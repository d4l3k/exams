Ques 2. [4 Marks] Consider the relation shown

B1

C3

a) List all the functional dependencies that
the given relation instance satisfies.
List

b) Assume that the value of attribute C of
the last record in the relation is changed
from C3 to C2. Now list all the functional
dependencies that this relation instance
satisfies.
Ques 3. [2 Marks] Consider a relation R = (A, B, C, D, E).
R is decomposed it into R1 = (A, B, C), R2 = (A, D, E). The set of functional dependencies
is:
A → BC
CD → E
B→D
E → A.
Show that this decomposition is a lossless-join decomposition.

Statements
a) If class (C5, DM) is deleted then
the information about student S7
would also be removed because of
deletion anomaly.

b) Inserting CLASS (C6, Calculus, 3)
is
an
example
of
insertion
anomaly.

Ques 5. [6 Marks] Consider the following two schemas
Schema 1: R (A,B,C,D)
Schema 2: R1 (A,B,C) and R2 (B,D)
Determine whether each of the following statement is true or false; briefly
justify your answer.
Statements
a) Consider Schema 1 and suppose that
the only functional dependencies that
hold on the relations in this schema are
AB and CD. Is Schema 1 in BoyceCodd Normal Form (BCNF)?

T/F?

b) Consider Schema 2 and suppose that
the only functional dependencies that
hold on the relations in this schema are
AB, A C, B A, AD and all possible
implicit FDs. Is Schema 2 in BCNF?

c) If AD is deleted from part (b). Is
Schema 2 in BCNF?

Brief Justification

Ques 6. [15 Marks] Consider the following relation R(A, B, C, D) and the functional
dependencies that hold over this relation.
F = A → B, D
C, D → B
C→D
B→D
a) Determine all candidate keys of R.

b) Compute the closure of {C, B}

c) Compute the minimal cover

d) Is R in 3NF? If not, then decompose it. Show all the steps. If you are
decomposing R then determine the candidate keys of each decomposed
relations.

SQL
Ques 7. [6 Marks] Consider the below relations where primary keys are underline and
foreign key is bold.
employee (ssn,name, address, phone)
project(pno, pname,essn)
Determine whether each of the following statement is true or false; provide a brief
justification of your choice. State any assumptions that you make.
Statements
a) In SQL, the query
“SELECT name FROM employee where
ssn>10”
will not return duplicates.

T/F?

b) Consider below queries:
Query 1: SELECT COUNT (*) FROM
employee
Query 2: SELECT COUNT(name) FROM
employee
Query1 and Query2 always return the
same result.

c) SELECT e.name FROM
employee e, project p
WHERE e.ssn = p.essn
is equivalent to
SELECT name FROM employee

Brief Justification

Ques 8. [5 Marks] Give the SQL command needed to create the Item relation. You may
choose the reasonable domains for your attributes. You must specify the following:
 ItemNo is the primary key
 {IName, Quantity} is a candidate key
 IName and Quantity are not allowed to contain null values
 Price must be greater than 100.

9

Ques 9. [6 Marks] Consider the following relations (Keys are underlined and foreign keys
are bold)
Author ( Name, Address, Gender, Research_area)
Journal (JName, Paper_title, Published_year, AName)
Write SQL statements that correspond to the following relational algebra expressions.

𝜋𝐽𝑁𝑎𝑚𝑒,𝑃𝑎𝑝𝑒𝑟_𝑡𝑖𝑡𝑙𝑒 (𝜎𝑃𝑢𝑏𝑙𝑖𝑠ℎ𝑒𝑑_𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟=2016 (𝐽𝑜𝑢𝑟𝑛𝑎𝑙))

𝜋𝐽𝑁𝑎𝑚𝑒 (𝜎𝐴𝑛𝑎𝑚𝑒=𝑛𝑎𝑚𝑒 𝐴𝑁𝐷 𝑝𝑢𝑏𝑙𝑖𝑠ℎ𝑒𝑑_𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟=2016 (Author X Journal))

Ques 10. [24 Marks] Consider the Company database schema and instances given in
Appendix A. Use SQL to answer the following questions. Please make sure that your
queries do not include any extra information.
a) For each project, retrieve the project number, the project name, and the number of
employees from department 5 who work on the project.

b) Retrieve the name of all employees who have two or more dependents. (Use nested query)

11

c) Create a view that has employee name, supervisor name, and employee salary for each
employee who works in the ‘Research’ department

d) Retrieve all employees whose address is in Houston, Texas

12

e) Retrieve the list of all project numbers for projects that involve an employee whose name is
‘John Smith’, either as a worker or as a manager of the department that controls the project.

f) Retrieve the name of all employees who works on all projects controlled by department
number 5.

Datalog
Ques 11. [12 Marks] Consider the following relations (Primary keys are underline and
foreign keys are bold):
Paper(title, citation, AName,year,JName)
Journal(JName, year, PName, AName)
Author (AName, RArea)
Where Aname is author name, PName is publisher name and RArea is research area.
Write Datalog to answer the following queries.
a) List the journal name and author name of all journals in the database.

b) List the name of journals in which papers are published by authors having research area
“Databases”

A continuation of the above question; the relations are listed here again to prevent having
to look them up
Paper(title, citation, AName,year,JName)
Journal(JName, year, PName, AName)
Author (AName, RArea)
Where Aname is author name, PName is publisher name and RArea is research area.
c) List the citation of all paper authored in 2016 or authored by Hazra Imran
