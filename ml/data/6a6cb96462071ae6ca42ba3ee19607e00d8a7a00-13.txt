Question 1. [10] Formal Proofs in Predicate Logic
a. [4] Prove that :
~∀x∈D, ∃y∈D, (P(x, y) ∧ ~Q(x, y)) ∨ ( P(x, y) ∧ Q(x, y) ) ≡ ∃x∈D, ∀y∈D, ~P(x, y)
Proof:

b. [6] Provide a formal proof (by using one formal rule of deduction at a time and explicitly stating
the rule that is used on the right side) for the following argument. You may assume that a∈D,
b∈D and c∈D:
∀x∈D, ∀y∈D, (∃z∈D, W(x, z) ∧ W(y, z) ) → x=y
W(a,b)
a=c ∨ ~W(c,b)

Question 2. [8] Proof Techniques I
Express each of the following statements in predicate logic, and then suggest an appropriate proof
strategy for it (pick one of the techniques we have seen in the class: witness proof, generalizing from a
generic particular, proof by cases, contrapositive proof or proof by contradiction ). Note that you must
NOT prove the statement. You just need to suggest a proof strategy which is the most substantial part
of the proof of the statement..

a. [2]

2
For any integer n if n mod 5 is 3 than n mod 5 is 4. Recall that x mod y is the remainder when
x is divided by y.
Formula:

Proof strategy:

b. [2]

If the product of two positive real numbers is less than 10000, at least one of them is less than
100. Use R+ to represent the set of all positive real numbers.
Formula:

Proof strategy:

c. [2]

Not every animal that has wings flies (use A for the domain of all animals, W(x) ≡ x has wings
and F(x) ≡ x flies ).
Formula:

Proof strategy:

d. [2]

For every integer n, n2 is odd if and only if n is odd (use predicates Odd(x) and Even(x) to
indicate odd and even integers) .
Formula:

Question 3. [8] Proof Techniques II: Complete the Proof
The following is an incomplete proof for the statement
for any integer n, n2 – 2 is not divisible by 4
We first express the statement in Predicate Logic using the predicate
Divisible(x,y) ≡ x is the product of y and another integer k.
Some parts of the proof are left out and are shown by "______". Fill in these parts to complete this
proof.
Proof:
Expressed in Propositional Logic, the statement that we need to prove is:
___________________________________________
Let n be any non specific integer. We need to show
____________________________________________
Assume that
____________________________________________ (1)
is true and we'll derive a contradiction.
From (1)
n2–2 = ______________________ for some integer k

or

_____________________________________ (2)

Since n2 is even, n must be even by the relevant theorem we have proved in the class.
Let n = ___________________________ for some integer m.
From (2) we get
____________________ = 4k+2
or
_______________________________
But the left hand side of this equation is even and the right hand side is odd. This is a contradiction.

Page 6 of 10
Therefore we can conclude ~Divisible( n2–2, 4).

Question 4. [10] Proof Techniques III
Provide a proof for the following statement :
For all integers m and n, if m+n is even then m and n are
both even or m and n are both odd
You must first express the statement in Predicate Logic and then construct a proof by contraposition
following the basic steps we discussed in the class. You can use the predicates Even(x) and Odd(x)
to indicate that x is an even or odd number.
The statement in Predicate logic:

Proof:

Question 5. [ 16] Finite State Automata
Consider the following DFA:

a. [4] Which of the following sequences of 0's and 1's are accepted by the DFA? Simply circle
one of the choices besides the input sequence:

b.

i.010101

YES

NO

ii.01111

YES

NO

iii.0111110

YES

NO

iv.011110

YES

NO

[4] Using the cases you have seen in (a) provide a short description of the language that is
accepted by the automaton.

c. [4] The following is the truth table that describes the transition function for the first two
states of this automaton. Fill in the part of the table that defines the transitions from states 2
and 3.

d. [4] Suppose we implement this automaton in the way we discussed in the class (using
flip-flops for the current state, a multiplexer that selects the next state etc.). Provide the
circuits that will implement the transitions for states 0 and 1 as they are defined in the above
table.

Question 6. [8] Sequential Circuits
In Lab 5 you learned how to use a D flip-flop to design a frequency divider and used that idea to develop
a counter. Using this idea, complete the circuit that is given below to create a 3-bit counter that counts
from 0 to 7 each time the clock ticks (low or high).
Your design CANNOT use any additional clocks or D flip-flops. You may only use wires and simple
gates to complete your circuit. Note that for this circuit you don't need to use any of the 3 pins that are
on the south side of the flip-flops. Use only the pins that are on their east and west sides.
Make sure that your circuit counts from 0 to 7 and that the output pins bit0, bit1 and bit2 have
the corresponding bits of the counter value.
