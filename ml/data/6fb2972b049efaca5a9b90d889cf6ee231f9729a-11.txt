1. [4] Is the following statement is a tautology, a contradiction or neither? Justify your answer using a
method of your choice.
(( p q)  ~p) ~q

2. [6] Translate the following sentences into propositional logic using the following variables with the
given meaning:
w = the weather improves
g = we run out of gas
d = we will get to our destination
t = we will be late

a. Unless the weather does not improve or we run out of gas, we will get to our destination,
but we will be late. (recall p unless q means if ~q then p)

b. Assuming that we will not run out of gas, if the weather improves, we will get to our
destination but we will be late.

5. [8]

Consider the following digital circuit:

This circuit is input/output equivalent to another one that uses exactly one logical gate with two
inputs. Show the simpler circuit by answering the following:
a. [2] Write a propositional logic expression which is the direct translation of this circuit to
propositional logic. Do not simplify your expression.

b. [4] Using a sequence of logical equivalences (showing the rules as well), simplify this
expression to one that has only two propositional variables.

c.

[2] Finally draw the circuit corresponding to the simplified expression.

7. [8]Circuit Design 1
Design a 3-inputs minority circuit. This circuit has three inputs x, y and z, and should output True if
at most one of x, y, z is true. The circuit should output False if two or more of x, y, z are true.

 C(x): x is/was a member of the Conservative Party.
 F(x): x likes fishing
 L(x): x is/was a member of the Liberal Party.
 W(x): x is a woman.

i. Every Canadian prime minister is/was member of either the Liberal or the Conservative
Party.

ii. Every woman who is/was prime minister of Canada is/was a member of the conservative
Party.

b) Translate each of the following predicate logic statements into English.
