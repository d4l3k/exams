Question #1 [16 points total]: Theories of Human Performance
(a) “Spotlight” and “FINST” are two theories of how ___attention ___ works.
Describe each, highlighting the difference between the two. [5 pts]

The “spotlight” theory of attention is based on a unitary locus of attention that the user controls by
scanning through space.
The “FINST” theory (Fingers of Instantiation), is based a set number (4-7) of attentional tokens
which are “indexed” by having a FINST assigned to them.
1 pt for “attention”, 2 pts for getting key aspects of each of the theories right.

(b) Name three principal types of human memory, writing them into the 3 boxes below. Name the
mechanisms by which information moves among the different memory types, and indicate these
information pathways using arrows between the boxes. A point will be subtracted for each incorrectly
drawn arrow. [11 pts]

sensory
(or echoic / iconic / haptic)
attention

Question #2 [16 points total]: Communication and Collaboration
Some important social aspects of group problem-solving include
•

proximity and awareness of the presence, participation and activities of all members of the group;

•

simultaneous access of all members of the group to artifacts that store information, help to express
ideas, or mediate interaction;

•

facilitation of turn-taking.

You are designing a system that will support realtime web conferencing among project team members
working for a large but geographically distributed company. Users will access the tool from their desktop
computers. Due to the remote location of many of the company’s offices, streaming video and audio
through the computer interface cannot technically be supported, nor is a simultaneous telephony (voice)
hookup feasible. Viable candidates for communication include any computer-based communication with
relatively low throughput requirements - e.g. text, simple graphics or snapshots and sounds.

(a) List two kinds of constraints being imposed on this design. [4 pts]
1.

Technological

2.

Social

(b) Given these constraints, describe a mechanism by which two of these aspects of group problem solving
might be addressed (1-2 sentences each). Address both what the feature is, and how it addresses that
aspect of concern. The first one is completed as an example. [6 pts per mechanism]

Aspect

Design Mechanism

Proximity /
Awareness

An icon or avatar on the screen represents each remote member of the conference,
which moves about or changes state in response to the number of exchanges that
individual has made in the last 5 minutes. The icon thus displays some measure of that
individual’s participation in the conversation.

Simultaneous
access

Turn-taking

E.g. a shared sketchpad is visible in a window to all conference participants. If one
user draws on the sketchpad, this information is updated immediately in the view seen
by all the others.

E.g., only one member is able to draw on the sketchpad at once. The avatar of the
current “sketcher” is highlighted in the other members’ view, so they know who is
drawing. To request permission to sketch, a non-drawing member clicks on the
highlighted icon, and this appears as a blinking avatar in the active sketcher’s
display. To grant permission to sketch, the active sketcher clicks on the requestor’s
avatar, thus relinquishing control over the sketch.

Question #3 [28 points total]: Design Process
You’ve been given the challenge of designing the web-conferencing system described in the previous
question. You need to plan the process you will take, to get from the general situation of concern (as
stated in previous question) to a fully functional prototype approved by all critical stakeholders. Given the
time scale and resources allocated to the task, you decide to take a formative approach.

On the following page, diagram 6-10 steps of a possible design process which encompass the following:
• Include the points at which you propose to include users, a
justification for doing so, and how;

Step i: : activity
[description of step]

• Indicate with arrows where you are likely to iterate on stages in
the design, as demonstrated in diagram at right.
• For each step, state the primary activity of that step (e.g.
“prototype functional flow” or “evaluate appearance
prototype”), AND describe the activity and its objectives in
more detail (one sentence).

Iterate

Step i+1: activity
[description of step]
Step i+2: activity
[description of step]

• For prototyping and evaluation steps, the activity description
should include the general type of prototype you would expect to build or the type of study you’d
conduct, based on the information you expect to need at that point.
There is no single correct answer to this question, although there are some key steps that should not be
omitted. Sequencing and to some degree inclusion can vary (and does, in the real world), depending on
constraints and the nature of the problem. Credit will be given for reasonable and well-justified answers; and
for completeness of the overall process. [28 pts]
Answer on following page. No credit will be given for marks on this page.
Answer should include the following elements:
-

[4 pts] Near the beginning, some form of pre-design observation and data gathering

-

[4 pts] Multiple prototyping / evaluation pairs (at least 2), in reference to formative approach

-

[6 pts] Mention of different and appropriate types of prototypes (e.g. appearance / functional)
and evaluation methods (e.g. informal – such as questionnaires, focus groups, interview;
observation methods; and formal - controlled.)

-

[4 pts] Iteration, demonstrated by arrows as above, and probably following the outcome of an
evaluation step

-

[5 pts] Overall completeness

-

[5 pts] Overall sensibility of approach

Question #4 [27 points total]: Evaluation Methods
Below are several scenarios where some type of evaluation is called for. For each, discuss the following in
the corresponding boxes below. As usual, there is more than one good answer to each part (there are also a
lot of not-very-good answers).
1. What is an important, generally stated experiment question that urgently needs to be answered? [3
pts each]
2. What type of study or other exposure would most appropriately address this question? State
whether you need formal or informally obtained data, as well as experiment technique chosen from
those mentioned in class. Justify your response in 1-2 sentences. [3 pts each]
3. What kind of prototype, setup or environment do you need in order to do this study, if any?
Describe its key capabilities as well as its ideal user group in 1-2 sentences (e.g. “Appearance
mockup which demonstrates the handheld communicator’s overall size, styling and button locations;
users are 10-14-year old girls). [3 pts each]

Scenario A: You have just been put in charge of a design team in the early stages of developing a
concept for an onboard automobile navigation system. The leading approach employs an LCD screen in
the center console that shows location obtained through an onboard GPS (global positioning satellite)
overlaid on an area map. Technologically, the most feasible candidates for input mechanism seem to be
voice, touchscreen and a multi-purpose knob. Your marketing people tell you your target customer is aged
55-70, male and in a middle-income bracket. This is a new demographic for the company, which has
always focused on the low-end market. Before you came, the team had never heard of “user-centered
design”, and Marketing thinks it means keeping current on Car & Driver1 editorials.

1.

Possible good questions: Does the customer want a navigation system? What performance
capabilities or limitations therein does this demographic have? What else is the customer doing
when driving a car?
Bad question: What’s the difference in performance among the candidates for input mechanism?
(we aren’t ready for that yet).

2.

Types of studies: just about any informal pre-design user study can probably fit some aspect of this
need. E.g. ethnographic (although there may not be time for that) contextual inquiry, observation of
how drivers use maps in cars now, questionnaire/focus group, even general performance capability.

3.

Kinds of prototypes: Some types of study would not need a specially built prototype, however all
would benefit from some kind of prop or environment. E.g. a car equipped with a camera in which
subjects can be studied while driving and navigating; or an appearance mockup of several initial
concepts that would be shown in a focus group to gauge interest.
Users will be members of the target demographic.

Scenario B: You are halfway through the design of a new campus-wide electronic vending machine
system at UBC. Users may purchase vending card credits, usable via a magnetic card at any vending
machine location, and manage their account online. An earlier survey has demonstrated widespread
support among UBC students for this approach, especially if a wider selection of merchandise may be
purchased in this way. The detail design of the vending machine interface is well underway, and you’ve
been asked to start on the online part. One of your team members thinks it should include a clickable map
of where the machines are located, their current contents and a way to request new contents as well as
personal account management. Another is full of ideas about how this system should be linked to
students’ university Ids and/or copycards. There are many, many other ideas from the team. At this point,
you’re not sure what functions the online access should include or what it should look like.

1.

Possible good questions: How much functionality should the online access include? Should it be
simple or comprehensive? How much complexity is the user willing to deal with? What functions
are most important to the user, and will they be likely to access from a website? Given several
alternative design “looks” and layouts, which seem most preferable to the user?
Bad question: Any kind of performance-related question, or anything based on a detailed or
functional mockup. Not ready for that yet. Also, not interested in what’s for sale in the vending
machines, or in general support of idea of vending machines and method of payment (have
addressed that already in previous survey).

2.

Types of studies: optimal studies for most of above questions are sitting on border between predesign familiarization and evaluation of early prototypes. For example, questionnaires, surveys and
focus groups; and/or observation while using informal mockups of several design approaches.

3.

Kinds of prototypes: needed only for a study that asks for responses to informal mockups (e.g.
observation or focus groups). Probably no special setups required. Users should be UBC
inhabitants who indicated greatest support on the original surveys (since they’re most likely to be
using it).

Scenario C: Your company produces the #1-selling personal financial accounting software in North
America. Your main product has over the years become a massive program with a huge number of
functions, and a redesign is needed for the next product release (on a tight timeline) to make it easier for
novices to use while maintaining the overall functionality for expert users. A large number of approaches
have been storyboarded; the design team has merged these into three concrete and quite different design
proposals.
1.

Possible good questions: Which of the three general approaches is going to result in the most usable
design for novices, as measured by learnability, errors, number of functions accessible, etc..

2.

Types of studies: Depending on details of question, this could be a controlled study, some type of
informal approach (e.g. observation while using prototypes, or possibly (not so good) a focus group.
Bad answer: CW / HE aren’t too good since design team and expert user are not likely to be ideal
for simulating novice user behavior.

3.

Kinds of prototypes: definitely need prototypes here. If a controlled performance study or
observation while using, need a functional mockup. Alternatively, an appearance mockup or paper
prototype for a focus group, but this is a less preferred approach.

Question #5 [15 points total]: Modeling User Activity
The “GOMS” method, or keystroke-level analysis, is one way of obtaining an empirically based dynamic
model. Given the following task, two action sequences for accomplishing this task, and the empirically
derived data provided on the following page, predict the following:
(a) How many seconds (to 1 decimal point accuracy) will each sequence require to execute? Show your
work below (next to action sequence description) to get partial credit for an incorrect answer. [8 pts]
Sequence 1:

Sequence 2:

4.36 sec

4.18 sec

2 pts given for getting Seq 2 > Seq 1; 3 pts per correct value
(b) What is the problem with the slower sequence (i.e., what makes it slower)? [2 pts]
Sequence 1 is slightly slower even though fewer individual keystrokes are required, because it
requires an additional mouse movement: at 1.1 seconds, this is a pretty slow operation.
(c) Propose another action sequence that would be faster than either of these. How long will it take? [5 pts]
Points given for any reasonable response; [3 pts for describing a plausible action, 2 pts for giving
correct time]. For example: double-click on the whole word then retype it (1P+4B+8K =
1.1+0.4+8x0.28 = 3.74

Task: Rename a file in a File Manager window in a Microsoft Windows desktop. Make the following
assumptions for both action sequences:
• One file is to be to be renamed.
• The File Manager window is on top
• File name is visible and can be pointed to
• Original name is “exam2.doc” and new name is “midterm2.doc”
• Hand starts and ends on mouse
• User is average non-professional typist (40 wpm)
Action sequence 1: Select “exam” and then type “midterm”. The exact sequence is:
1. place cursor before “e”
2. press and hold mouse button
3. drag cursor to after “m”
4. release mouse button
5. type “midterm” (7 characters)

Action sequence 2: Place cursor between “m” and “2”, backspace to start of word then type “midterm”. The
exact sequence is:
1. place icon between “m” and “2”
2. backspace to start (4x)

Information for Question #5
NO CREDIT GIVEN FOR ANYTHING WRITTEN ON THIS PAGE.
EXAM CONTINES ON FOLLOWING PAGE.
Empirically derived Operators & Times – source: Kieras, 1993
K - Keystroke (.12 - 1.2 sec; 0.28 recommended for most users). This operator is pressing a key
or button on the keyboard. Pressing the SHIFT or CONTROL key counts as a separate keystroke.
Different experience levels have different times for the K operator:
•

Expert typist (90 wpm):

0.12 sec

•

Average skilled typist (55 wpm):

0.20 sec

•

Average nonprofessional typist (40 wpm):

0.28 sec

•

Worst typist (unfamiliar with keyboard):

1.20 sec

T(n) - Type a sequence of n characters on a keyboard (n × K sec). This operator is simply a
shorthand for a series of K operators, and would normally be used only when the user is typing a
string of characters that is a single "chunk," such as a filename.
P - Point with mouse to a target on the display (1.1 sec). This operator represents the action of
moving the mouse to point the cursor to a desired place on the screen. The actual time required can
be determined from Fitt's law.
B - Press or release mouse button (0.1 sec). This is a highly practiced, very rapid movement. Use
0.1 sec for pushing the button down or letting it up.
BB - Click mouse button (0.2 sec). Pushing and releasing the mouse button rapidly, as in a
selection click, counts as two B operators, for a total of 0.2 sec.
H - Home hands to keyboard or mouse (0.4 sec). Since the targets are pretty large, and the
movement well practiced, moving the hand between keyboard and mouse, and vice-versa, is
relatively fast.
M - Mental act of routine thinking or perception (0.6 - 1.35 sec; use 1.2 sec). The M operator is
intended to represent routine thinking, not complex, lengthy, problem-solving, racking the brain, or
creative meditations. In a variety of routine computer usage tasks such as word processing and
spreadsheet usage, these routine pauses are fairly uniform in length, justifying the simplifying
assumption that all Ms take the same amount of time, around one sec.

Question #6 [10 points total]: Goal-oriented action
Norman’s model of goal-oriented action consists of 7
stages that span 3 kinds of activities (goal setting,
execution and evaluation), listed in the box on the right.

1. Establishing the goal to be achieved
2. Forming the intention for action to
achieve goal
3. Specifying the action sequence
corresponding to the intention

Two major points of Norman’s model are that
(a) There are perceptual “gulfs” to be crossed as the user
proceeds from goal setting to execution, and from
execution to evaluation of his/her action – i.e. the user
has to figure out how to get from one action stage to
the next.
(b) Users often iterate in this process.

4. Executing the action sequence
5. Perceiving the system state
6. Interpreting the perceived system state
7. Evaluating the system state with respect
to the goal and the intentions

Below is a description of a user proceeding through a task that should be familiar to you. Please state what
Samantha (the user in the example) might do to cross each gulf. There are multiple good answers.
Samantha Serious, a student in CPSC 444, is trying to figure out when the first deliverable for the term
project is due, and what exactly it includes. She hasn’t yet explored the Project page of the 444 website,
so doesn’t know for certain what she’ll find there; however, she has looked at the schedule page and
downloaded lecture notes from it. She starts now at the main (syllabus) page of the site.

Note: Do not feel you have to refrain from criticizing the 444 website in answering this question - base your
answer on your own experience as a user of the site.
For each of the following, answer in about one sentence:
(a) What is Samantha’s goal? [1 pts]
Goal is to determine when the first deliverable for the term project is due.

(b) How might Samantha “cross the gulf” between goal and execution? That is, after looking over the
syllabus, what action might she decide on (specify) to move closer to her goal? [3 pts]
A couple of possible answers: she might remember that she saw something about due-dates on
the schedule page (which she’s already examined), and go there by clicking on the Schedule navbar and scroll through the page looking for the information; or, she might elect to try going
directly to the projects page using the project nav bar button and scrolling through that page.
(c) How might Samantha “cross the gulf” between execution and evaluation? That is, once executed,
how will she decide whether the action stated in (b) accomplished her goal? [3 pts]
She would simply ascertain whether the information she needs is found there. This is a matter of
perception and interpretation (Norman’s steps 5 and 6); i.e. no action taken.

(d) Let’s say she determines that the action stated in (c) failed to accomplish her goal. What might she
do next? What step in Norman’s model does this correspond to? [3 pts]
She might decide she needs to go somewhere else in the site to find all the details she needs (for
example, date is on the schedule page, but details are a couple of layers down in the project
page). She thus iterates all the way back to Norman’s steps 1 (establishes a new goal), and on
through steps 2-7. Alternatively, she might just give up at this point!

Question #7 [18 points total]: Persuasion
Briefly describe a product or website that employs the technique of “macrosuasion”. It can be a real existing
product/site, or a fictitious one (i.e. you can make it up for the purpose of this question). The topic of
macrosuasion may be anywhere on the spectrum of conventional / serious to radical / absurd; but it must do a
good job of illustrating the concept. Do not use any of the examples shown in class; no credit will be
given for them.
(a) What is the product/site’s name or title? If you’re not sure of the actual name, approximate it; and of
course make up the name of a fictitious product/site. [1 pts]
Examples from class included: Baby Think It Over, QuitSmoking,, HygieneGuard (or something like
that)
(b) State the intent or goal of the product/site’s macrosuasion, in about one sentence. [4 pts]
Baby Think It Over: persuade teenagers to not engage in practices that might result in their having to
care for a baby before they’re ready to.

(c) List two mechanisms by which the product/site attempts to achieve this goal. Use about one sentence
to describe each mechanism. [6 pts]
1. Produces a doll that cries all the time, which the teenager needs to carry around with her/him;
for use by high school educators
2. Training materials for instructor to use

Next, you will briefly describe a product or website which uses (somewhere within it) the technique of
“microsuasion”. Again, you may use either real or fictitious sites or products. Do not use any of the
examples (applications or mechanisms) shown in class; no credit will be given for them.
(d) What is the site’s or application’s general function? (Your answer should be at the level of “a web
search engine”, “personal accounting software”, “internet chat room”, etc.) [1 pts]
An example from class: ebay customer rating system
(e) State the intent or goal of the site’s microsuasion, in about one sentence. [3 pts]
Persuade customers to be responsible purchases / sellers, i.e. follow through on their stated
commitments.
(f) Describe the microsuasive element, using about one sentence. [3 pts]
Shows colored stars and numbers next to customer’s profile whose value indicates their record.

force feedback in the steering wheel. The driving student now feels bumps when he drives over or
collides with obstacles, and resistance when he turns too sharply. He also feels vibrations when he drives
over the speed limit (it is a simulation of an older car which does not like to move very fast). As with the
previous design, he also has visual feedback in the form of a graphical display of a road and obstacles
and signage.

Design a controlled experiment to test whether this addition of force feedback improves the tendency of
the driving student to drive safely during the simulation, by defining each of the following experiment
components. Note that there are many possible experiments; we are looking for reasonable answers.

(a) Hypotheses [4 pts]
Experimental:

e.g., Haptic feedback reduces the number of driving errors that the
driver makes during the simulation.
Note: must state a measurable performance parameter. Any
reasonable one accepted.

Null:

Haptic feedback has no effect on the number of driving errors made
during the simulation.

(b) Ideal subject pool [2 pts]:

At least two possibilities: novice drivers and “problem drivers” – e.g.
those with poor driving records.

(c) Experiment task. Be concise
but specific; include relevant
details relating, for example, to
test environment the subject
will encounter, and how you
will appropriately motivate the
subject. [5 pts]

e.g., Drive a test route with and without haptic force feedback. The
test route should include a variety of obstacles and posted speed
limits. The subject will be directed to complete the test course as
quickly as possible while driving safely.

(d) Independent variable [2 pts]:

Presence or absence of haptic feedback as described above

(e) Dependent variable [2 pts]:

1. Time taken to complete course
2. Number of safety-related errors made (e.g. speed limit exceeded,
center line crossed, etc).

(f) Possible nuisance variable (list
one) [2 pts]:

e.g., whether subject has had past experience with haptic feedback in
driving games, or with this simulator in general. Also driving history
in general.

(g) Randomization (at least 2
ways) [2 pts]:

- Order of presentation of haptic / no haptic condition
- Order of types of obstacles presented during driving task
- Individual differences

(h) Analysis (type of t-test) [1 pt]:

Question #10 [18 points total]: Statistical Analysis
For this question, you will carry out a simple t-test on the provided data and make an experimental
conclusion.
Sam Sleepresearcher hypothesizes that people who are allowed to sleep for only four hours will do
significantly better on a user interface test of a web search function than those who are allowed to sleep
for eight hours. He brings sixteen participants into his lab and randomly assigns them to one of two
groups. In one group he has participants sleep for eight hours and in the other group he has them sleep
for four. The next morning he administers the SPAT (Sam's Performance Ability Test) to all participants,
wherein each participant must find as many specified items on the web as possible within a time limit
using the provided search tool.

The data provided on the following page are subject performances on the SPAT. They range from 1-9 with
high scores representing better performance.
In computing your t-statistic,
•

Show all intermediate steps, making use of blank columns in the data table as needed (be sure to label
any column used).

Question #11 [16 points total + 5 extra credit]: Physical Interfaces
(a) What’s the functional difference between a “button” and a “handle”-type physical computer interface?
What kind of control activity does each lend itself well to? [4 pts]
Buttons are for initiating something automatic; handles are for maintaining close control.
Alternatively: buttons are for discrete actions, handles are for continuous actions.
2 pts for defining each of buttons and handles in one of the above 2 ways.
(b) Give 3 examples of computer-supported interfaces or functions of interfaces that are well suited to
button-like interaction. [6 pts]
1.
2.
3.
Any kind of discrete control. E.g. typing, punching calculator buttons, power switch, “send” button
on an online form.
(c) Give 3 examples of computer-supported interfaces or functions of interfaces that are well suited to
handle-like interaction. [6 pts]
1.
2.
3.
Any kind of continuous control. E.g., drawing / sculpting with a computer-based application, musical
instrument (computer generated music).
EXTRA CREDIT [1-5 pts]
Suggest an example (other than those shown in class) of a useful physical metaphor that could be
implemented in a haptic interface. For example, mentioned in class where the debit card whose “weight” you
could feel when you swiped it, representing the amount of money in the account; and the “clutched film reel”
metaphor for browsing streaming media such as video. Partial credit will be given according to the quality
and innovativeness of the idea. This is a shameless ploy to exploit the creative brains in this class for
research ideas. If I think it’s really good and original, I’ll ask you for permission to implement the metaphor
in my research lab – and if it still seems good after prototyping, credit you appropriately in any publications
which result.
