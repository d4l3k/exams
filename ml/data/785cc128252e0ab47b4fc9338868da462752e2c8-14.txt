Question #1 [16 marks total]
This questions tests your knowledge of GOMS techniques as discussed in Chapter 8.

In class and in the text we used GOMS to analyze the task of making text bold face in a word processor,
such as MS Word. There are four parts of the GOMS model. In the spaces provided below and on the next
page, name each of the four parts, give a description of each part, and provide an example of each part as it
would be used to analyze the task of making text bold face in MS Word. Treat the cases for boldfacing a
few letters within a word, one entire word, and multiple consecutive words.
(a) Part: Goals
Description: Goals define the end-state that the user is trying to
achieve. Top-level goals are subdivided into subgoals, corresponding
to the division of a task into subtasks.
Example: There is a two-level hierarchy of goals for the boldfacing
task.
Main goal − turn desired text to bold
Subgoal-1 − specification of text to turned to bold
Subgoal-2 − change the specified text to bold
(b) Part: Operators
Description: Operators are the basic actions available to the user for
performing a task.
Example: For the boldfacing task the basic operators
fundamental actions with the mouse and keyboard:

are

the

click down, click up, and move the mouse, along with
type a key on the keyboard.

(Continue your answer to Question #1 here for the final two parts of GOMS.)

(c) Part: Methods
Description: Methods are sequences of operators (or procedures)
accomplishing a goal. Compound operations are methods.

for

Example: There are two sets of methods, one for specifying text and
one for changing it to boldface:
The sequence double-click (click down, click up, click down, click up
all in rapid succession) specifies a full word.
The sequence click down, move mouse pointer, click up specifies the
text between the click-down point to the click-up point.
The sequence control-B changes the specified text to boldface, and so
does move mouse to BOLD-button, click up/down. Two longer sequences
are move to FORMAT menu, click down, move to FONT, click up, move to
dialogue box, double-click on BOLD and a similar sequence that ends
with click down/up on BOLD, move mouse pointer to OK and click
down/up or with typing "ENTER" on the keyboard instead of the final
click down/up.
(d) Part: Selection rules
Description: Selection rules are invoked when there is a choice of
methods to accomplish a goal. Selection rules often have criteria to
determine which method will be invoked under various circumstances.
Example: For the boldfacing task a selection rule based on a criteria
of fastest is best would select double-click to specify a full work,
but would use click-up/move/click-down for both of the other types of
text (less than a single word and more than a single word).
Similarly, either typing control-B or moving to the BOLD-button will
be faster than the other two methods. Which is fastest will depend on
the homing time to switch the hands to the keyboard from the mouse,
and the position-dependent movement time to reach the BOLD-button
(Fitts’s Law).

Question #2 [23 marks total]
This question tests your knowledge of the requirements definition as it pertains to interactive systems,
which was discussed in Chapter 7.

(a) [8 marks] Identify the two main groups of stakeholders who read requirements. For each group,
include a list of stakeholders in that group, and briefly describe the reasons that each stakeholder in
the group has for reading the requirements.
Group 1: Clients are composed of:
users need to know how the system will support their activities.
managers of the users also need to know that the system will support
their activities, and that their employees will be able to use it.
trainers need to know what skills will be required of users and what
support features and documents will be provided with the system to
assist with training.
marketeers need to know that the system will meet the needs of
customers (current or future).
purchasers/buyers need to know what activities will be supported and
what performance can be expected.

Group 2: developers are composed of:
Designers need to know what to specify in their designs, and how the
designs will be evaluated (i.e., what performance targets have been
set).
implementers need to know what to build and how it will be tested.
marketeers need to know that the system will meet the needs of
customers (current or future).
testers, documenters, and quiality control engineers need to know the
standards to which the system is to be built.

(b) [9 marks] List the three different contexts in which the development process can take place, identify
the relative degree of formality and detail normally present in requirements for each of the three
contexts, and identify the key stakeholders and their roles for each context.
Context 1:
Perhaps the most common context these days is the product
organization (companies such as Adobe, Alias|wavefront, or Microsoft)
that are developing new systems for commercial sale. Especially when
the applications involve novel applications, there may be only very
sketch requirements documents to start with, with much of the detail
evolving as a result of experience gained with early prototypes and
initial versions of the product as they are shipped to customers.
The clients are often a marketing team within the company, because
users and other stakeholders are not yet identified, although
whenever possible the marketing team will try to work with current
customers or known early adopters.
The developers are a team of
designers and builders (programmers). Examples are Adobe Acrobat for
distributing documents, Alias|wavefront Maya for 3D animation, and
Microsoft Excel for financial and accounting spreadsheets.
Context 2:
Within a user organization systems may be developed ‘in house’ for
internal use. The requirements documents are often fairly informal
and less detailed, because there is an expectation that they will
evolve during the course of the project. Both the clients and the
developers work in the organization. Most often the clients are a
committee of management and users, and the developers are an in-house
software development team. An example of this would be Air Canada’s
Gemini system for airline reservations, which was originally
developed for use by Air Canada and its affiliates, and later sold as
a product to other airlines.
Context 3:
Contract development requires the most formality and detail in
requirements documents because the clients are usually a user
organization and the developers are an outside contractor hired
specifically to design and implement the system, primarily to write
the software. The requirements are often prepared by a third- party
organization, such as a management consultant, hired specifically for
that task. An example is the UBC Financial Management System, which
was developed by PeopleSoft under contract to UBC.

(c) [6 marks] Discuss the differences between validation and verification of requirements by giving
definitions for each and relating them to the problem statement, the requirements documents, and
the prototypes that may be built as part of the design process.
Validation: This is often referred to as ‘building the right system’, in
other words a requirements document that defines a system that will
resolve the situation of concern that is part of the problem
statement. Both analytical and and empirical techniques, although
analytical techniques are preferred because they are often faster
and can be used without having to build prototypes.
When purely
analytical techniques cannot be used, empirical testing using
prototypes may be needed.
This is the case most often when
performance levels are being checked and there is no predictive model
to estimate performance based solely on the design. In all cases the
goal is to demonstrate that the system specified in the requirements
document will resolve the situation of concern.

Verification: This is often referred to as ‘building the system right’,in
other words a system that matches the requirements document.
Standard verfication and testing techniques from software engineering
can be used to verify correctness of the system (functional
requirements), but performance requirements usually require testing
(empirical studies). Usually this are done with the specification
for
the
system
(a
detailed
description
that
reduces
the
implementation to routine engineering tasks), or in some cases the
actual system, although prototypes can be used if there is reason to
believe that the final system will have similar performance. It is
always important to state requirements in such a way that they can be
verified. Valid requirements that cannot be verified are of no use
in the design process.

Question #3 [12 marks total]
This questions tests your knowledge of the ethical requirements for research involving human subjects.

(a) Who provides approval when Requests for Ethical Review are submitted at UBC?
A university committee of researchers administered through the Office
of Research Services, which reports to the Vice President Research.
(b) How long does it typically require to obtain ethics approval once the appropriate forms and
attachments have been submitted?
Four to six weeks is the normal time required. The committee meets
on a regular basis, so it depends a lot on when the request is
submitted relative to the meeting schedule.
(c) List two types of documents that may need to accompany the forms requesting ethical approval.
There are many documents that may need to be submitted as
attachments: samples of consent forms, questionnaires advertisements
for subjects, approval certificates from external agencies, special
deception forms describing any information that will be withheld from
subjects and the debriefing process that will take place after the
study, telephone contact forms, and samples of authorization and
release forms for videotaping subjects.
(d) List three specific types of information that subjects have a right to know prior to their providing
informed consent to participate in a study.
The principle of informed consent holds that subjects have a right to
know and understand the purpose of the study, the procedures that
will be followed in the study, any payment or other consideration
they will receive for participating, the degree of confidentiality of
any information about them that is collected, and contact information
for obtaining more information about the study or to file any
complaints they may have about the conduct of the study. They also
have right to know any risks or discomfort involved, and that they
have the right to withdraw at any time.
(e) What are the two types of release/authorization that may have to be obtained when videotaping of
subjects is performed?
Permission must be obtained to record video information about
subjects, which includes the use of the video for purposes of
analysis in the study.
Separate permission is usually required to present the video either
for purposes of training (such as in courses) or dissemination of the
results of the research (such as at academic or professional
conferences), and this must include a right to approve any editting.
(f) Do experiments conducted by students in a course using other students in the course as their subjects
require submission of an ethics request?
No, ethics approval is not required in this case, although the
instructor for the course does need to file an annual summary of the
instructions provided to students.

For each statement below, write the number of the term listed on the previous page that best fits into the
missing space marked by
in the sentence.

[2 marks each]
_14_ (a)

A team of evaluators, usually three to five people, is employed in heuristic evaluation using a
process of aggregation to produce a comprehensive list of problems.

_10_ (b)

The theory of exploratory learning has four components: goal setting, exploration, selection,
and assessment.

__5_ (c)

cognitive walkthrough is a usability analysis method based on this four-component theory
(goal setting, exploration, selection, and assessment).

_18_ (d)

keystroke level analysis is a usability analysis method based on GOMS.

_13_ (e)

Requirements that specify the activities or tasks that the system is supposed to support are
functional requirements.

_22_ (f)

Requirements that set targets for levels of user activity (such as speed, error rate, error
recovery) that the system is supposed to enable are performance requirements.

_18_ (g)

keystroke level analysis is a special case of GOMS that was devised by Card, Moran and
Newell (1983).

_17_ (h)

The symbol K was used by Card, Moran and Newell for their key press operator.

_25_ (i)

The symbol R(t) was used by Card, Moran and Newell for their response by the system
operator.

_19_ (j)

The symbol M was used by Card, Moran and Newell for their mental preparation operator.

__4_ (k)

Card, Moran and Newell proposed that all but the first M in a string of MK operators be
deleted if the string is a cognitive unit.

_24_ (l)

Because many aspects of usability are hard to define in words, we sometimes include a
prototype in the requirements document, even though it may have been built using totally
different software than what will be used for the finals system.

_11_ (m)

In an empirical study external validity asks whether the results generalize.

_26_ (n)

In an empirical study statistical validity asks whether the results might be just a fluke.

__6_ (o)

In an empirical study construct validity asks whether we are measuring what we think we are
measuring.

_16_ (p)

In an empirical study internal validity asks whether there are logical or causal relationships
among what we are measuring.

__8_ (q)

In an empirical study ecological validity asks whether the results are realistic.

_12_ (r)

In an empirical study face validity is another name for asking whether the results are realistic.

_20_ (s)

When we conduct an experiment and measure a dependent variable, we almost always see
differences in measurements across experimental conditions. The null hypothesis is that any
such differences are due entirely to variations among the population, and not to our deliberate
change in the experimental conditions.

__9_ (t)

The experimental hypothesis is that our change in the experimental conditions has had an
effect, which is reflected in our measurements.

_30_ (u)

A type II error occurs when we fail to observe a difference in the means when sampling from
two distinct populations that have population means that differ − we don’t find something that
really is there.

_29_ (v)

type I error occurs when we observe a difference in the sample means even though we are
sampling from the same population − we find something that is not there.

_28_ (w)

A t-test is a statistical test that can be used to determine how likely it is that two samples with
different sample means are actually different.

__2_ (x)

A Chi-square test is a statistical test that can be used to determine how likely it is that a
questionnaire or survey has correctly identified people’s preferences among a set of design
options.
