3. (1 pt) Draw a picture of the object below transformed by the above matrix

4. (1 pt) Give sequence of OpenGL commands necessary to implement the above transformation.

5. (2 pts) Draw houseA and houseB, transformed by the appropriate OpenGL commands. The untransformed house is
below.
glIdentity();
glTranslate(1, 0, 0);
glRotate(90, 1, 0, 0);
glPushMatrix();
glTranslate(0, 2, 0);
drawHouseA();
glPopMatrix();
glTranslate(-1, 0, 0);
drawHouseB();

6. (1 pt) Give the series of affine transformations (assuming postmultiplying) needed to create the picture below, assuming
the house started from the position shown in the above questions.

7. (1 pt) The point coordinate P, as shown below to the right, can be thought of as P = 1*i + 3*j, where i and j are basis
vectors of unit length along the x and y axes, respectively. In effect, a coordinate system is defined by the location of its
origin, and its basis vectors. Describe the point P in terms of the 3 other coordinate systems given below.

8. (1 pt) Normalize the homogenous point (2,4,6,2).

9. (1 pt) Draw the cavalier projection of a box of size x=4, y=2, z=6. Use a 20 ◦ projection (that is, the z axis in the scene
should make a 20◦ angle with the x axis in the projection). The drawing doesn’t have to be exactly to scale, but you must
label the point locations.

10. (2 pts) Derive a 4x4 matrix that when applied to the point (x, y, z, 1) T would result in the projection in the picture below.
Show your work.

11. (1 pt) Sketch a side view (yz plane) of the perspective view frustum, in VCS, that is specified by the following parameters:
near = 3, top = 2, right = 1, far = 5, bot = -1, left = -1

12. (1 pt) Write out the OpenGL perspective transformation matrix for the above configuration.

5

13. (1 pt) Briefly describe how to implement per-object picking using the back buffer.

14. (1 pt) A point in a triangle can be expressed using barycentric coordinates as follows: P = αP 1 + βP2 + γP3 , where
0 <= α, β, γ <= 1 and α + β + gamma = 1. Draw the line corresponding to α = .6 on the following triangle which
sits in the xy-plane.

15. (1 pt) Briefly describe how to use parity when scan converting a general polygon.

In the problems below, use the Phong illumination model given by I = I a ka + kd IL (N · L) + ks IL (R · V )n with
parameters Ia = .8, IL = 1.0, ka = .2, kd = .9, ks = .5, n = 30.
