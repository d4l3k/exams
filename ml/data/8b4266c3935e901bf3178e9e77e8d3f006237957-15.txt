– Keep your answers short. If you run out of space for a question,
you have written too much.
– The number in square brackets to the left of the question number
indicates the number of marks allocated for that question. Use
these to help you determine how much time you should spend on
each question.

[12] 1. Answer each question with True or False, and then justify your answer briefly.
[2] (a) The Master theorem can be applied to the recurrence relation


T (n) =

T (bn2/3 c) + n
Θ(1)

if n ≥ 2
if n = 1

to prove that T (n) ∈ Θ(n).

[2] (b) A divide and conquer algorithm always splits a problem into approximately equalsized subproblems.

[2] (c) The worst-case performance for the Randomized Caching algorithm discussed in
class is at least as good as the worst-case performance for the Least-Recently-Used
Caching algorithm.

[2] (d) Let S be a skip list with 25 keys. It is possible that every node of S, except for the
head node and the tail node (if the implementation uses one), will have only a single
level.

[2] (e) Amortized analysis is used to obtain a tight bound on the running time of one operation on a data structure.

page 3 out of 6
[2] (f) When we use the potential method for amortized analysis, the potential of a data
structure can only become negative after an operation has been performed if it becomes ≥ 0 during the execution of the next operation.

[7] 2. In class, we proved that given the recurrence


T (n) =

aT (n/b) + f (n)
Θ(1)

if n ≥ n0
if n < n0

and a value n = bt , the function T (n) is equal to
Θ(nlogb a ) +

t−1
X

aj f (n/bj ).

j=0

[2] (a) Where did the term Θ(nlogb a ) come from?

[2] (b) Where did the term

Pt−1 j
j
j=0 a f (n/b ) come from?

[3] (c) How is this formula related to the three cases of the Master Theorem?

[9] 3. Prove upper and lower bounds on the function T (n) defined by


T (n) =

2T (n/2) + 8T (n/4) + n2
1

if n ≥ 4
if n ≤ 3

Your grade will depend on the quality of the bound you provide (so, proving that T (n) ∈
Ω(1) and T (n) ∈ O(100n ), while true, will not give you many marks).

[13] 4. The Hidden Surface Removal problem occurs in Computer Graphics and can be described
as follows: you are given a collection of coloured objects, which are projected onto a screen
to produce an image. The objects are at different distances (depth) from the screen; objects
that are closer cover those that are further back. The problem is to decide how to color each
point of the screen.
In this question we consider the one-dimensional version of the problem: each object is
an interval on the x-axis, with a depth and a color, and can be represented by a 4-tuple
(xl , xr , d, c). For instance, (0, 4, 3, blue) is an interval that goes from x = 0 to x = 4, has
depth 3, and color blue.
[10] a. Describe an efficient divide-and-conquer algorithm that takes as input a collection
of n shapes, and returns a list of 4-tuples (xl , xr , d, c) where such a 4-tuple indicates
that the points from x = xl to x = xr should be colored c (and the line segment
with that color is at depth d). For instance, given the shapes
(2, 5, 1, red), (9, 10, 6, red), (0, 4, 3, blue), (1, 8, 5, green)

your algorithm should return
(0, 2, 3, blue), (2, 5, 1, red), (5, 8, 5, green), (9, 10, 6, red).

(the vertical bars were added as separators between colors because the exam is
printed in black and white). More space is available for your answer on the next
page.

[3] b. Analyze the running time of your algorithm.

[4] 5. Mr. Isulo, an alien computer scientist, decided he does not like the definition of good pivot
used in the expected time analysis of the RandomizedQuickSelect algorithm. Instead,
he decides to call a pivot good if bn/10c ≤ leftsize ≤ n − 1 − bn/10c. That is,
good pivots are any pivot that ends up in the middle 80% of the array after the call to
RandomizedPartition.
What recurrence relation would Mr. Isulo get for the expected time E(T (n)) of algorithm
RandomizedQuickSelect using his definition of good pivot?
