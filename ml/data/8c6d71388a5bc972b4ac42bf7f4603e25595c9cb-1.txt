Question #4 [6 points total]: User Abilities
You are redesigning the project below, involving a large-screen display, to be installed at the downtown
headquarters of a bank, for the general public to experience the “joy” of real-time stock trading.
48 popular stocks and their prices are displayed on a 4 x 3 meter screen in real-time. Customers stand 2-3
meters away and use a handheld device to buy and sell stocks.
A section of the prototype display is shown below. When a price goes up (above start-of-day price), it is
displayed in green; when it goes down (below start-of-day price), it turns red. Everything is on a vivid blue
background, and all colours have the same brightness.

Users must be able to recognize price changes and make trades quickly. It is particularly important to know
when a price is up for the day, and it suddenly goes down below the start-of-day price, and vice versa. It is
also helpful to know prices that are way up or down compared to their start-of-day price. Unfortunately, the
current design does not adequately draw the user’s attention to the price changes.
(a) When a price changes, the text label changes between “up” and “dn”. Drawing from your knowledge of
visual perception, give one reason why this change doesn’t draw the user’s attention. [1 pts]

(b) Price changes are also shown in different colours, and we learned that colour changes can be effective for
drawing the user’s attention. However, this design suffers from several problems related to the use of
colour. Identify two of them. [2 pts]

Question #11 [12 points total]: Statistical Analysis
Buggy Inc. is a company that specializes in the development of visual debugging interfaces for large,
complex software engineering projects. They recently developed a software package (called Bug-free) that
uses an innovative scheme to highlight syntax errors in code. Because their package has the exact same
functionality as a software package sold by one of their competitors (called Debugger), they ran a
controlled experiment to see which of the two software packages is more usable. They hoped to show
that their package is more usable than their competitor’s for both novices and experts, but suspected it may
only be the case for novices. The study compared how rapidly users can find syntactic errors in their code
and how quickly their interface allows them to make corrections.
2 Independent variables: (1) software package (Bug-free, Debugger; within subjects); (2) user expertise
(novice, expert; between subjects)
2 Dependent variables: (1) time to find errors; (2) time to fix errors
Study design: 10 novices and 10 experts each completed 5 tasks in each of the two software packages. (The
order of seeing the software packages was fully counterbalanced.)
Results: These two
graphs show the

Question #12 [15 points total]: Design Process
Together with a few friends, you’ve come up with what you believe is a really neat and novel design idea,
namely a public electronic message board. Current message boards (in places like the UBC sub and bus
loop) are a mess, and you think it would be easier if people could post to them in person, perhaps using a
cellphone or PDA as an input device, and/or remotely through a web interface. The goal is to design an
easy to use large screen public message board.
You need to plan the process you will take, to get from the general design idea (just described) to a fully
functional prototype approved by all critical stakeholders. Given that you have approximately 3 months for
this task and a small team who are all trained in HCI techniques, you decide to take a user-centered
design approach.

On the following page, diagram 6-10 steps of a possible design process that encompasses the following:
• Include the points at which you propose to
include users, a justification for doing so, and how;

Step i:
[description of step]

• Indicate with arrows where you are likely to iterate
on stages in the design, as demonstrated in diagram
at right.
• For each step, state the primary activity of that step
(e.g. “prototype functional flow” or “evaluate
appearance prototype”), AND describe the activity
and its objectives in more detail (one sentence),
AND state the output of that step.
• For prototyping and evaluation steps, the activity
description should include the general type of
prototype you would expect to build or the type of
study you’d conduct, based on the information
you expect to need at that point.

output of step i

Iterate

Step i+1
[description of step]
output of step i+1

output of step i+2

Step i+2
[description of step]

There is no single correct answer to this question, although there are some key steps that should not be
omitted. Sequencing and to some degree which steps are included can vary (and does, in the real world),
depending on constraints and the nature of the problem. Credit will be given for reasonable and well-justified
answers; and for completeness of the overall process. [15 pts]
