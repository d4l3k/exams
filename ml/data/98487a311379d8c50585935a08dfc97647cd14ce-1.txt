Question #4 [8 points total]: User Abilities – Motor Processing + Empirical Laws
(a) Explain with reference to an empirical law discussed in class why it is faster to have a “reduced” toolbar
that contains only the icons a user actually uses rather than a “full” toolbar (i.e., the default toolbar that
contains all the icons). Assume that in the reduced toolbar all unused icons are removed, and all
remaining icons stay in their original position. Name the law and describe it in plain language. [4 pts]
Name the relevant empirical law [1 pt]: _______________________________
Describe the law in plain language (you may provide the formula, but it is not necessary and this does
not negate your need to describe the law in plain language) [1 pt]:

Explain why it is faster to have only the icons a user actually uses on the toolbar [2 pts]:

(b) In Fitts’s Law research, in order to compare the results of one experiment to the results of another
experiment, it is necessary to normalize error rates. Explain why this is the case with respect to the
speed-accuracy tradeoff. [2 pts]

(c) Two novel input devices were evaluated in a Fitt’s Law experiment. Device A showed an index of
performance of 10.4 and Device B’s was 5.8. Assuming a properly run and analyzed experiment, which
device would you adopt (assuming you need to pick one of the two)? Explain your answer. [2 pts]

Question #5 [9 points total]: Experiment Design, Analysis, and Report Writing
(a) A company that develops 3D modeling software for the film industry is testing out two prototype
interfaces for a new quick-sketch application they are developing. One of the prototypes relies on a
traditional mouse-and-keyboard interface while the other relies on a stylus (pen)-based interface. They
hypothesized that the stylus interface would be faster than the mouse-and-keyboard interface.
Unfortunately, after conducting a simple two condition experiment with 10 participants, where 5
participants used one prototype, and 5 used the other, their statistical analysis found no statistically
significant difference between the two interfaces.
i.

What valid conclusions can the company come to about the difference between their interface
prototypes? Explain your answer. [2pts]

ii.

Identify two things that the company could do to make their future user studies comparing the
two interfaces more statistically powerful. [2pts]

(b) Your 444 assignment consisted of writing a report about a soft keyboard typing experiment. The
following statements are related to that experiment. In which report section should each
statement be found: Conditions, Discussion, Procedure, Results, or Tasks? [5 pts]
i.

“The finding that participants’ typing speed was faster on the alphabetic keyboard than
keypad is consistent with MacKenzie et al.’s (1999) previous findings.” ______________

ii.

“Participants were shown a demonstration of the two layouts. Participants were then
asked to complete a questionnaire on their typing experiences.” ______________

iii.

“Participants were given the same three sentences for each layout - one practice sentence
followed by two sentences. None of the sentences contained capital letters, since one
could not capitalize letters in the prototypes.” ______________

iv.

“No significant main effect of phone keypad experience on task completion times was
found. In addition, no significant interaction of keyboard layout and phone keypad
experience level on error rates was found.” ______________

v.

“We compared two soft keyboard layouts: the phone keypad layout and the alphabetic
keyboard layout. These layouts are described next.” ______________

Question #6 [12 points total]: Field Study
Current message boards at UBC (in places like the SUB and the bus loop) are a mess, and your interaction
design consulting company suspects it might be easier if people could post to them electronically, perhaps
in person using a smartphone as an input device, and/or remotely through a web interface. Before your
company can move in this design direction, however, you need to better understand how message boards
are currently being used. Your goal is to conduct an initial exploratory field study to gather information to
clarify how message boards at UBC are being used.
1. Provide two focal points for your initial study, and briefly justify each one. [6 pts]
2. Provide three interview questions related to each focal point (6 questions in total). [6 pts]

Wendy Mackay’s “Using Video to Support Interaction Design”. Briefly describe three different ways
that video can be used in early design stages, and explain why video is especially useful for each. [6

smart table) in an architectural firm. The firm has the table installed in their primary meeting room and
intends to use it for team reviews of architectural drawings. You are going to collect data from the first 6
meetings that make use of the interactive table top, and are considering using video and/or field
observations notes for data collection. List 3 pros and 3 cons of using video, relative to field observation
notes, for this situation. Explain which technique (video and/or field observation) you would decide
to use in the end. [7 pts]

Question #10 [14 points total]: Statistical Analysis
A graphics company is trying out a new interactive technique for one of its 3D software packages. The
company hopes that the new technique will improve performance (time and accuracy) for doing 3D
manipulation tasks (tasks that are known to be time intensive and error prone). The company ran a controlled
experiment to see if their new technique does in fact offer performance improvements. Given that there is
some evidence that females and males differ in their visual-spatial abilities, gender was controlled for.
2 Independent variables: (1) technique (new, status-quo; within subjects); (2) gender (male, female;
between subjects)
2 Dependent variables: (1) time (in seconds, lower is better); (2) accuracy (1-10 scale, higher is better)
Study design: 10 males and 10 females each completed 5 tasks using each of the two techniques. (The order
of seeing the software packages was properly counterbalanced.)
Results: These two graphs show the means (across all 5 tasks) for each dependent measure:

A 2-way ANOVA (technique X gender) was run for each of the dependent variables:
