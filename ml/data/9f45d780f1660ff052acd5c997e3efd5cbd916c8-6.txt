Question 1.
a.
b.
c.
d.
e.
f.
g.
h.

False. We don’t always desire our DB to be in BCNF
False. Weak entities do not have a key. They depend on other entities.
True
False. In any table, each attribute functionally depends on the key.
True
True
True
False. TRC and DRC are stronger that RA

Question 2
a.
i) The ISA relationship must be disjoint.
B and C must have the same attributes.
ii) The ISA relationship must be total.
b. The set of the common attributes of R1 and R2 (A, D) is a key for R2.
Proof:
1.
2.
3.

AÆ C
A, D Æ C, D
A, D Æ E

given
1, augmentation
2, C, D Æ E, transitivity

c.
i) The company should be an attribute of the customer, assuming each customer works for a
single company. We don’t need to keep any information for each company.
ii) The loan should be a separate entity set associated with a customer through a relationship .
Reasons:
• A customer may have more than one loans.
• A loan has additional information on its own.

Question 3
a.

1. phn
2. pname, address

b
Patient ( phn, pname, address, illness, ward )
Test ( testname, labtype, dname, specialization )
Test includes the Authorizes relationship set.
Doctor ( dname, specialization )
Had ( phn, testname, date, result )
c.
•
•
•

The only table that is not in BCNF is the Patient table.
FD illness Æ ward violates BCNF.
We split the table into
Patient ( phn, pname, address, illness )
IllnessWard (illness, ward )

Question 4
a.

π sId (σhCity = “Vancouver” (Hotel )) - π hId ( σ year = 2005 ( Booking ))
NOTE: The following is WRONG:

π sId (σhCity = “Vancouver” ∧

year ≠ 2005

( Booking ZY Hotel ))

Any hotel which has a booking for a year other than 2005 will be included in the result even if the
same hotel HAS another booking for 2005!

b.

π gId, hId (σtype = “suite” (Booking ZY Room )) / πhId (σhCity = “Vancouver” (Hotel ) )
NOTE: Again, the following is WRONG:

πgId (σtype = “suite” ∧hCity = “Vancouver” (Booking ZY Room ZY Hotel ) )
This returns any guest who has booked a suite in some hotel in Vancouver.

c.
{ t | ∃ h ∈ Hotel ( t.hId = h.hId ∧ t.hName = h.hName ∧
∀ g ∈ Guest ∃ b∈ Booking ( h.hId = b.hId

∧ g.gId = b.gId ∧ b.year =2004 ) ) }
