Question #1 [24 marks total]
This question tests your knowledge of the eight usability factors discussed in the textbook.

(a) [12 marks] Name the eight usability factors and give a brief description of each one.
Speed of performance is how long it takes to complete the activity using
the system, and thus determines how many people may be required if there
is a time limit for when it needs to be finished. This interacts with
the next two factors.
Incidence of errors is both the probability of errors occurring, and
also the severity of the errors (a large number of minor errors may not
be as bad as even a few major errors). A high incidence of errors means
slower overall performance.
Ability to recover from errors is the ease with which users can correct
mistakes or slips that they make. Included in this is a concern for how
easily it will be for users to recognize that they have made an error.
Difficulty in recovering from errors slows down users; complete
inability to recover means the user has to start over.
Ease of learning to use the system is the amount of training required to
use the system. This costs money if employees are being trained (they
are being paid while they learn). Even when non-employees are trained
because the trainers are being paid and other resources may also be
required. For casual or novice users, there may be no opportunity for
training, so they have to be able to learn it on their own as they use
the system.
Retention of learned skills is important because re-training (or
refresher courses) costs money. Many systems are not used on a regular
basis by all users, but those users still need to understand how to use
the system each time they do use it. Transfer of skills from and to
other systems is related to this, and thus adherence to guidelines or
standards helps promote retention of learned skills.
Ability to customize the system is important because many systems are
used for a variety of tasks in many different situations, each with
their own requirements.
Different users often have quite different
personal styles and preferences for doing the same tasks, which should
be supported by allowing users to adapt the system to their style.
Ease of reorganizing activities affects how the activities that are
supported by the system can be modified and still be supported by the
system. This is in a sense a measure of how generalizable the system’s
capabilities are, as opposed to how specialized the system is to a
specific process for accomplishing certain goals. A good system can be
used to support other activities if those are reorganized to use the
system.
Users’ satisfaction is sometimes difficult to measure because it is
subjective and often intangible, but it is very important.
It can
easily be the critical factor in the success of a system; even if the
system scores high on all of the other factors, if users do not like it,
it may not get used. This is often what is meant by the over-used term
‘‘user friendly’’.

(b) [12 marks] Consider a computer system designed to support the human activity of voting, as in the
recent Canadian and U.S. elections. There are various stakeholders. List at least three sets of
stakeholders and discuss the relative importance to each set of stakeholders of each of the eight
usability factors by giving a ranking of high, medium, or low importance. Give a short (one or two
sentences) justification for all 24 of your rankings (three sets of stakeholders times eight rankings
each).
Voters want to know that they can recover from errors. They do not want
to spend any time learning the system. They probably would prefer that
errors be infrequent, but recovery is more important than incidence of
errors because they want to be absolutely certain that their votes are
counted correctly.
Most of the other factors are probably low in
priority, although speed of performance might be an issue if it causes
long delays while waiting to vote.

Candidates (and their parties) are most concerned about errors because
they have no control over how they are handled, but also would like to
ensure that recovery is possible so they are corrected when they do
occur. Concerns about speed of performance are similar to those for
voters, since most candidates probably feel that their supporters will
all turn out to vote, so they don’t want them leaving the polls due to
long lines.
Users’ satisfaction may be a concern, although the
candidates might also have a cynical view that their supporters will
vote no matter what, but other candidates’ supporters may not!

Election officials and workers have a primary responsibility to ensure
that the election runs smoothly, and is perceived to run smoothly, so
they will put speed of performance, incidence of errors, recovery from
errors, ease of learning, and retention of learned skills as high
priority because of these affects how well the voting process proceeds.
Customization, reconfigurability, and users’ satisfaction would all be
secondary concerns because they make it easier to administer elections,
but these are of lesser priority.
Speed of performance definitely
affects cost (elections have to take place in a single day, so if they
are slow, more workers and more equipment may need to be deployed, which
costs money).

Courts are charged with ensuring that elections are run honestly. Their
main concern is with the prevention of errors, with speed of
performance, recovery from errors, ease of learning, and retention of
learned skills all secondary and of interest only because they
contribute to a more reliable process. Issues such as customization,
reconfigurability, and users’ satisfaction are really no concern to the
courts.

It is important to recognize that ‘errors’ refers to errors made by
users and not errors made by the system, which is a legitimate concern,
but not one of the usability factors. HCI limits its attention to the
design of systems that reduce and hopefully minimize the likelihood of
human error. Other subfields of computer science worry about system
errors.
While there is some justification for including the people who build the
system as stakeholders, this is not usually done. Those who administer
or operate the system are stakeholders (and these are included above, as
part of the election workers).
Those who design and build the system are presumably supposed to take
their direction from the various stakeholders rather than have their own
priorities for usability factors. If they do their jobs correctly, they
will properly assess the priorities of the various stakeholders and
design accordingly, thereby assuring a successful system and thus they
will achieve their goals.
A Note About Marking: This question is clearly rather subjective.
The
marking scheme was thus fairly flexible, with most students getting a
mark in the range 9-10 if there answers were generally plausible.

Question #2 [13 marks total]
This question tests your knowledge of keystroke-level model and Fitts’s law.

In lecture we discussed the example of a microwave oven for which it might be faster to
heat water for 11 seconds than to heat water for 10 seconds.
Suppose that the microwave oven has a control panel that looks like the layout on the
right, with all of the keys 1.0 cm in width and centered 2.0 cm apart from each other in
both the horizontal and vertical directions. (Note that the START key is actually three
times wider than the others, but because all movement to it is ‘‘up’’, its effective width is
still just 1.0 cm like all the other keys).

START
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
0

The time required to strike a key in the keystroke-level model is 0.5 sec, which is an average that includes
both the time to move to the position of the key and the time to strike the key. A more accurate model
would take into account the variation in positioning time using Fitts’s law. The formula
T = 0. 25 + K log2 (2 A/W + 1) assumes that a single key press takes 0.25 sec plus the amount of time to reposition from the previous key to the new key. The textbook gives an estimate of 100 msec for the constant
K in the formula.
a) According to this formula, does hitting the key sequence 1-0-START take less time or more time than
the key sequence 1-1-START using this key layout?
b) What is the difference in time for the two sequences?
c) Is it faster to heat water for 11 sec or 10 sec using this microwave oven? Show your work. Use the
following table of logarithms and square roots, or you may use a calculator.

a) Obviously, without needing any calculation,
1-0-START takes longer than 1-1-START because the
number of keys is the same but movement is more.
b) To compute the difference, we need only consider
movement times for the 2nd and 3rd buttons in each
sequence; everything else is the same. The formula
given above for Fitts’s Law yields:

= K (log2 1 + log2 5)

T 1→1→START = K log2 (

= K (0. 00 + 2. 32) = K ⋅ 2. 32 = 232 msec
1-0-START takes 786 − 232 = 554 msec longer.
c) The time to heat water is the sum of the time to
hit the keys and the time spent heating. Heating
for 10 sec is still about half a second faster than
heating for 11 sec, even though hitting the keys
does take longer for the 10-second heating.

Question #3 [14 marks total]
This question tests your knowledge of Norman’s seven-stage model of task performance in which the
two categories of mental activity execution and evaluation are present.

List the seven stages in Donald Norman’s model and give a brief explanation of each.
Establishing the goal to be achieved using the system.
EXECUTION
Forming the intention for action that will achieve the goal that was
established.
Specifying the action sequence corresponding to the intention that was
formed.
Executing the action sequence through physical/cognitive activity.
EVALUATION
Perceiving the system state that results from the action sequence.
Interpreting the state of the system as perceived, usually by noting the
change in the perceived state from what it was prior to the action and
deducing from this how the actual state has changed. Even if perception
is accurate, this stage can be faulty if the user does not have a good
understanding of the system.
Evaluating the system state with respect to the goal and intentions to
determine if the goal has been achieved, or if a new subgoal needs to be
established.
Physical activity is required in addition to mental activity only to
execute the action sequence and in perception (especially haptic
perception). The other stages only require mental activity.
The difference between the user’s intention and the user’s evaluation is
the expectation that needs to be fulfilled by further activity.
Norman defines the difference between how users think of their goals and
how those goals are realized physically in the system as presenting
designers with a cognitive ‘gulf’ that should be minimized by making
users’ conceptual models match as closely as possible the actual system
model.
A Note About Marking: Some people confused the activity above as being part
of the design process. Norman’s model is about how people carry out any
type of activity, but mostly short-term activities (such as buying a
Coke or getting money from an ATM).
All of the steps are either
cognitive (taking place in the person’s mind as he or she does the
activity), or are perceptual or motor activity in support of that
cognitive activity.
The theory does apply to longer-term activities
(such as the design process), but it’s introduction in the textbook is
for the purpose of identifying a particular way in which people perform
tasks, not higher-level processes.
