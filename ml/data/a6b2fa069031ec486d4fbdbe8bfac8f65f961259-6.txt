Question #1 [18 points total]: Usability Metrics
You’ve been assigned by your employer (a user interface consulting firm) to help another firm evaluate
their in-house calendaring system prior to a re-design. Incommunicado Inc., your client, is a managementconsulting firm employing about 100 individuals - most of who spend much of their time off-site with
their own clients. This calendar was custom-designed for Incommunicado two years ago, and employees,
who are required to use it, have been complaining about it ever since. Because of the amount of time
employees spend away from the office, and the need for employees to confer about their clients when
they’re back home, the calendar plays a central role in the company and it’s imperative that it work well.
Therefore Incommunicado’s VP of Administration would like to make sure that the problems are clearly
understood and quantified before commissioning a new system.
The primary purpose of the company calendar is to publicize time and location of scheduled meetings and
seminars, as well as planned individual absences due to business trips, vacation, etc. It relies on web
access (to which all employees have ready access, both when on-site and traveling) both to make entries
and to view. Typically, users submit an entry to the calendar when they have scheduled a meeting
involving several other employees, or when they know they will be out of the office for more than a few
hours. By looking at the calendar before scheduling a meeting, they theoretically can avoid conflicts with
other meetings, or absences of key attendees.
You’ve decided that as a first step, you should look at the existing calendaring system and evaluate it in
terms of relevant quantitative usability metrics. Below, list up to 6 additional usability metrics that are
likely to provide useful data for this situation. One is already listed as an example. For each metric,
make sure you identify exactly what is to be measured. [3 pts per metric]
0. Time required to create a new entry in the shared calendar
1.

…

Variants on the following responses were accepted. Points were subtracted if metric was not related to
this system, or if a non-quantifiable metric was used (i.e. there is no obvious way to measure it).
•

Time required to modify or delete an entry in the calendar, view a specific time or day in the
calendar, etc

•

Number of individuals required to make an entry in the calendar (e.g. does a secretary or
someone with special privileges have to authorize the entry?)

•

Frequency with which erroneous input is accidentally supplied to the system

•

User’s ability to recover from erroneous input

•

Time required for a user to learn to use any aspect of the system (e.g. entry input or viewing a
specific part of the calendar)

•

User’s retention of learning of system use

•

User’s ability to customize the system for their own situation

•

The ease with which users can reorganize their scheduling activities – e.g. change their methods
of scheduling meetings, view extra commitments, etc.

•

User’s satisfaction with the system.

Question #2 [28 points total]: Problem Definition
Your next step in the evaluation of Incommunicado Inc.’s offending calendar system is to create a
problem statement. After conducting some quantitative tests on the system and talking to a few
employees, you have tentatively defined a situation of concern that includes the following problems with
the existing calendaring system, among others:
•

Too many steps are required to make a new entry in the calendar. These include
accessing the web form, choosing a day, time and duration, choosing the list of
participants from a pull-down list of employees, choosing a location, submitting
the request, authorizing the request, and refreshing the database. The initial entry
process takes about five minutes for a group of 5 attendees (not including the
authorization delay). Users interviewed feel the process should take only one
minute for an attendee list of any length.

•

Before the entry appears in the public calendar, it must be authorized by one of
two secretaries with the proper system privilege. The authorization requirement
frequently imparts a delay between an entry request and actual appearance of up
to an entire day, and in the meantime individual schedules may change. Users
interviewed feel a delay guaranteed to be within one hour would be acceptable.

Create a one-line problem statement that, if executed, will resolve this situation of concern. In this
statement, identify each of the four fundamental components of the problem definition by circling and
labeling them. [7 pts per correctly mentioned and identified component]

Variants of the following were accepted: 3 pts per fundamental component mentioned and correctly
identified (12 pts total), and 4 pts per fundamental component included in the problem statement (16 pts
total). Points also subtracted if level of support was not quantified (-2 pts); the statement was not a
sentence; if components did not make sense with respect to each other; or if whole statement generally
didn’t make sense or say anything helpful.

form of solution
Modify the current online calendaring system to provide
rapid (1 minute) and automatically authorized (1 hour) event entry
by all company employees.

Question #3 [24 points total]: Human Performance
(a) List the three types of memory discussed in class and readings, in the order in which sensed
information travels through them. For each, describe the three attributes in terms of the specified
relative adjectives [14 pts]:

Rate of access

Rate of decay

Capacity

(rapid, slow)

(rapid, slow, never)

(small, large, infinite)

Points allocation for (a), total of 14:
•

Types named correctly (1 pt / type = 3 pts)

•

Types listed in correct order (2 pts)

•

Correct attributes (1 pt each, = 9 pts)

(b) The 7 ± 2 rule [4 pts]:
Briefly describe it (1 sentence):
We can remember 7 ± 2 chunks of information; therefore chunking information can increase the
short-term memory capacity [2 pts]

To which type of memory does it apply?

working [2 pts]

(c) State how information moves from memory module to the next [6 pts]:

Sensory to working memory:

attention [3 pts]

Working to long-term memory:

rehearsal [3 pts]

The words listed in the box are the ones given in class and in readings. For Working to Long-Term
Memory, partial credit (2/3) was given for near-synonyms such as “practice” or “repetition”.

Question #4 [18 points total]: Empirical Laws
You have been given the task of designing the menu system of a powerful CAD application. There are a
total of Ntot = 100 specialized tools which must be distributed into a set of menus; it will be up to you to
decide how many menus there should be.
As a first cut, you have decided to estimate the optimal number of menus (and items per menu) based
sheerly on speed of access by applying empirical laws to the problem. (Of course, there will be other
criteria as well, such as logical / semantic groupings of functions; but first you want to know
approximately how many items you should try to group together).
You know from cpsc444 that Hick’s law is the empirical rule that you need to apply in this case; looking
it up in your old textbook, you recall that it is defined as decision time = TDec = K log( N + 1) .
You thus need to determine the values of m and n which, based on Hick’s Law, should result in the lowest
total decision time, where

m
n
N tot

= number of menus
= avg. number of items per menu
= m × n = total # of menu items

(a) For this exercise, compute the total relative decision time (TDecTot / K) resulting from the values of m
listed in the table below. Show your work. [15 pts]
You may use either a calculator or use the table of logarithms at the end of the exam; please state which
method was used.
Method (check one):

table of logarithms

calculator

Answers are listed for both base-10 and (natural) logarithms, which produce the same relative trend.
Allocation: correct values of “n” (3 pts), recognizing equation must be applied 2x (6 pts), correctly
deriving equation (3 pts), and correctly computing values given equations you’ve derived (3 pts).

Log (6)+log(21)= 2.10 (4.84)

Log(11)+log(11)= 2.08 (4.80)

(b) Based on the results above, state your guess for the optimal values for m and n, as well as a brief
(1-2 sentence) justification. [3 pts]

m=n=10 delivers the best value of the cases tried here, and this also makes intuitive sense; however, the
curve is flattening out by then and there’s little difference between 5/20 and 10/10. (You could verify this
estimate either by computing another neighboring value or two (e.g. 9x11); or by actually optimizing the
base equation, TDecTot = K {log( n + 1) + log( m + 1)} , by taking its derivative and setting it to zero).

Question #5 [12 points total]: Requirements Definition
Okay, back to Incommunicado Inc. You’ve gotten a general idea of the problems with the current design,
and you’ve been asked to generate a requirements definition document for a re-design of
Incommunicado’s in-house calendaring system.
You’ve realized that this is clearly a complicated case: a lot of different people with different roles in the
company use the system – and of course by now, you’ve talked with representatives of each group and
received their individual perspectives.
Below, list three key stakeholders (groups or individuals) who will need to be involved in the redesign
process. [12 pts]
Note that there is not a single correct response to this question. Use your common sense.
Stakeholder 1:
Stakeholder 2:
Stakeholder 3:

Credit was given for all reasonable answers: 4 pts / stakeholder (12 pts total). Examples of possible
answers are listed below. Points were subtracted for answers that were unhelpfully vague (e.g.
“employees”: there are many possible roles an employee can take, and therefore different stakes. A VP,
consultant and a secretary are all employees.)
On the clients side, there could be:
•

Consultation team members (primary users) – traveling and non-traveling

•

VP of Administration, who apparently is responsible for having a good calendaring system

•

Financial officers, who will determine whether the company can afford it

•

IT staff in charge of maintaining the system

•

Administrative staff in charge of scheduling meeting rooms

On the developers side, there could be:
•

Designers (whoever is eventually given the job of actually defining the new system)

•

Programmers (whoever is eventually given the job of building the new system)

•

Management of your own company (interface design consultancy) who also needs to make a
profit on the whole business
