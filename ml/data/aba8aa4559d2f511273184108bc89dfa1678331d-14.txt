a)
List all the functional dependencies
that the given relation instance satisfies.

C​→​B
A​→​B
AC​→​B

b)
Assume that the value of attribute
C of the last record in the relation is
changed from C3 to C2. Now list all the
functional dependencies that this relation
instance satisfies.

Same as part (a). Functional dependency set
is unchanged.

Ques 3.​ ​[2 Marks]​ Consider a relation R = (A, B, C, D, E).
R is decomposed it into R1 = (A, B, C), R2 = (A, D, E). The set of functional dependencies
is:
A ​→​ BC
CD ​→​ E
B ​→​ D
E ​→​ A.
Show that this decomposition is a lossless-join decomposition.
R1 ​∩​ R2 = A;
-A is the common attribute between the two relations, thus we want to show that A is a
superkey of either R1 or R2.
(A ​→​ BC)
(A ​→​ ABC)
(R1 ​∩​ R2 ​→​ R1)
this is a lossless-join decomposition

Statements
a) If class (​C5, DM) is deleted then
the information about student ​S7
would also be removed because of
deletion anomaly.

b) Inserting CLASS (C6, Calculus, 3)
is an example of insertion
anomaly.

T/F?
T

T

Brief Justification
There is only one instance of C5,DM and
for student S7. If this row is removed we
also lose the information for student S7
since this is the only instance.

SID is part of primary key. Hence it must
be inserted and cannot be null

Ques 5. ​[6 Marks]​ Consider the following two schemas
Schema 1: R (A,B,C,D)
Schema 2: R1 (A,B,C) and R2 (B,D)
Determine whether each of the following statement is true or false; briefly
justify your answer.
Statements
a) Consider Schema 1 and suppose that
the only functional dependencies that
hold on the relations in this schema are
A​→​B and C​→​D. Is Schema 1 in
Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)?

T/F?
F

Brief Justification
Neither A nor C are keys, so A ​→ B
and C ​→​ D are BCNF violations

b) Consider Schema 2 and suppose that
the only functional dependencies that
hold on the relations in this schema are
A​→​B, A​→ C, B​→ A, A​→​D and all
possible implicit FDs. Is Schema 2 in
BCNF?

T

A+ = {A,B,C,D}
B+ = {A,B,C,D}
Both A and B are superkeys for R1
and R2

c) If A​→​D is deleted from part (b). Is
Schema 2 in BCNF?

T

Removing A->D, A still remains the
Superkey for R1. R2 by itself is in
Primary key because it has 2
entities and trivial FD.

Ques 6. ​[15 Marks] ​Consider the following relation R(A, B, C, D) and the functional
dependencies that hold over this relation.
F = A ​→​ B, D
C, D ​→​ B
C ​→​ D
B ​→​ D
a) Determine all candidate keys of R.
The two attributes that don’t appear on the RHS of any FD are A and C
A​+​ → ABD - Not a key
C​+​ → CD - Not a key
AC​+​ → ACBD - This closure gives us all the attributes and is a key.
If we add any other attributes to AC, it will be a superkey and AC is therefore the
only key of R.
b) Compute the closure of {C, B}
CB​+​ → CB - Trivial
CB​+​ → CBD - From the third or fourth FD
Answer:
BCD
c) Compute the minimal cover
Step 1 - Split the FDs to only have 1 attribute on the RHS:
A→B
A→D
CD → B
C→D
B→D
Step 2 - Try to reduce the LHS of every FD:
We can only do this for CD → B
CD​+​ → CDB
D​+​ → D
C​+​ → CDB

6

We can remove D from CD → B making the new set:
A→B
A→D
C→B
C→D
B→D

Step 3 - Remove redundant FDs

d) Is R in 3NF? If not, then decompose it. Show all the steps. If you are
decomposing R then determine the candidate keys of each decomposed
relations.

We add the missed FD A → B as R4(AB) and get the final scheme:
R1(BD), R2(CB), R3(AC), R4(AB)
Candidate keys are R1 : {B}, R2 : {C}, R3 : {AC}, R4{A}
SQL
Ques 7. ​[6 Marks] ​Consider the below relations where primary keys are underline and
foreign key is bold.
employee (ssn,name, address, phone)
project(pno, pname,essn)
Determine whether each of the following statement is true or false; provide a brief
justification of your choice. State any ​assumptions​ that you make.
Statements
a) In SQL, the query
“SELECT name FROM employee where
ssn>10”
will not return duplicates.

9

T/F?
F

Brief Justification

b) Consider below queries:
Query 1: SELECT COUNT (*) FROM
employee
Query 2: SELECT COUNT(name) FROM
employee
Query1 and Query2 always return the
same result.
c) SELECT e.name FROM
employee e, project p
WHERE e.ssn = p.essn

F

Explanation: They will return a different
result if employee contains tuples with
null values for name, since the first
query will count those tuples, while the
second will not.

F

is equivalent to
SELECT name FROM employee

Ques 8. [5 Marks] ​Give the SQL command needed to create the Item relation. You may
choose the reasonable domains for your attributes. You must specify the following:
● ItemNo is the primary key
● {IName, Quantity} is a candidate key
● IName and Quantity are not allowed to contain null values
● Price must be greater than 100.
create table Item (
ItemNo varchar(16) primary key,
IName varchar(50) not null,
quantity varchar(200) not null,
price float,
unique (name, quantity),
check (price > 100))
