Signature:

– You have 150 minutes to write the 11 questions on this examination. A total of 98 marks are available.
– Justify all of your answers.
– You are only allowed to bring in one hand-written (or printed
using at least a 11 point font), double-sided 8.5 x 11in sheet of
notes.
– Keep your answers short. If you run out of space for a question,
you have written too much.
– The number in square brackets to the left of the question number
indicates the number of marks allocated for that question. Use
these to help you determine how much time you should spend on
each question.
– Use the back of the pages for your rough work.
– Good luck!

[6] 1. Short answers
[3] a. What is wrong with the following circuit?
a

on
off

b

on
off

[3] b. Explain briefly the difference between the purpose of a half-adder and that of a fulladder.

[6] 2. Let A = {1, 2, 3 . . . , 299, 300}.
[3] a. Give an example of a function f from Z+ into A that is not onto (surjective).

[3] b. Consider the function f : {1, 2, . . . , 18} → A defined by f (x) = x2 − 3x + 3. Is f
one-to-one (injective)? Explain why or why not.

[9] 3. Number representation
[3] (a) What unsigned integer is represented by the 9-bit value 100111011?

[3] (b) What signed integer is represented by the 9-bit value 100111011?

[3] (c) A professional programmer wrote a program that takes a floating point number x,
sets its value to 0, and then adds 0.1 to x repeatedly until it becomes equal to 10,
printing each value of x as it goes. Why does the program produce the output
0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6
1.0000001 1.1000001 1.2000002

[12] 4. Consider the following circuit:
reset

char
oneBit
valid bit

on
off

C E
D

C E
Q
Q

D

Q
Q

The terminal and the oneBit subcircuit provide bits one at a time to the remainder of the
circuit, and the clock attached to the D flip-flops ticks each time a bit is available.
[4] a. Suppose that the user first flips the reset switch on, then off, and finally types in the
digits 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0 in this order. What will be the state of the LED (on/off)
after each of the digits is typed (you need to provide 8 answers).

[4] b. Explain in English the purpose of this circuit.

[4] c. Show how to modify the part of the circuit that is inside the gray box so the LED
would be on if an odd number of 1 digits had been typed, and off if an even number of
1 digits had been typed. Hint: you will only need one flip-flop, and a few other gates.

[7] 5. Determine the validity of the following argument. Justify your answer fully.
1. (∼ p ∨ q) → r
2. r → (s ∨ t)
3. ∼ s ∧ ∼ u
4. ∼ u →∼ t
∴p

[9] 6. A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its divisors (except itself).
For instance, 28 is perfect since 28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14. In this question, we will look at
almost-perfect numbers: numbers that are one more than the sum of their divisors (except
themselves). For instance, 16 is almost perfect since 1+2+4+8 = 15. Consider the following
statement:
Given any positive integer n, we can always find an almost-perfect number that is
larger than n.
[3] a. Translate this statement into first-order logic (that is, using predicates and quantifiers).
You may assume the existence of a predicate isAlmostPerfect.

[6] b. Prove the statement. Hint: look carefully at the example I gave, and see if you can
make it more general.

[11] 7. Let U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12}, and f be a function from U into U. Finally, let
F : P(U) → P(U) be the function defined by
F (X) = {f (x) | x ∈ X}
For instance, if f (x) = 13 − x, and X = {1, 3, 4, 7}, then F (X) = {f (1), f (3), f (4), f (7)} =
{12, 10, 9, 6}.
[7] a. Prove that for every two subsets A, B of U, we have F (A ∩ B) ⊆ F (A) ∩ F (B).

[4] b. Give an example that shows that F (A−B) is not necessarily a subset of F (A)−F (B).

[8] 9. The inhabitants of the country of Pirlouitland use only three kinds of coins, worth 1 schlip, 5
schlips and 10 schlips respectively. Johan, one of the knights, makes the following observation:
For every amount n ≥ 10 schlips, the way to pay for n schlips that uses the fewest
coins always contains a 10 schlip coin.
Prove Johan’s observation using an indirect proof. Hint: think of substituting some coin(s)
for other coin(s).

[12] 10. Mathematical Induction
[3] a. Explain briefly the two forms of mathematical induction discussed in class.

[9] b. Recall that ⌊x⌋ is the largest integer that is ≤ x, that ⌈x⌉ is the smallest integer that
is ≥ x, and that ∀x ∈ R+ , ⌊x/2⌋ + ⌈x/2⌉ = x.
Let p0 , p1 , p2 , p3 , . . . be a sequence of integers defined by
p1 = 0, p2 = 1

and

pn = p⌊n/2⌋ + p⌈n/2⌉ + 1

for all n ∈ Z+ where n ≥ 3.

For example, p3 = p⌊3/2⌋ + p⌈3/2⌉ + 1 = p1 + p2 + 1 = 0 + 1 + 1 = 2
Prove that for all nonnegative integers n ≥ 1, pn = n− 1. You must state the induction
hypothesis clearly.

[10] 11. Consider the set L of all strings over the alphabet {a, b, c, d} that start and end with the
same letter, and do not contain this letter in any other position. For instance, the strings a,
bb and cabbac belong to L, but the empty string and the strings acccb and cabcbac do not.
[7] a. Design a DFA that accepts every string in L, and reject every other string.

[3] b. Write a regular expression that matches exactly the strings that belong to L.
