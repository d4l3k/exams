1. Coordinate Frames

(a) (2 points) Express point P and vector V in each of the two coordinate frames.

(b) (2 points) Find the 3 × 3 homogeneous transformation matrix which takes a point
from frame A coordinates and expresses it in terms of frame B coordinates. I.e.,
determine MA→B , where PB = MA→B PA .

(c) (2 points) Suppose that coordinate frame C as shown on the figure is the current
coordinate frame. The following OpenGL transformations are then applied. Sketch
the new coordinate frame on the figure and label it as coordinate frame D.
glTranslatef(3,1,0);
glRotatef(90,0,0,1);
glTranslatef(1,0,0);

2. Colour Representation

(a) (2 points) Sketch a typical RGB monitor gamut on the CIE chromaticity diagram
shown above. Label each of the R, G, and B locations.
(b) (1 point) Label the area in the CIE chromaticity diagram that contains “nonspectral” colours.
(c) (2 points) What is the dominant wavelength of the colour D on the chromaticity
diagram? Which spectral colour is complementary to D?

(d) (1 point) Compute and illustrate where the colour (X, Y, Z) = (10, 20, 10) would
be located on the CIE chromaticity diagram.

(e) (1 point) Suppose a colour sent to a printer has (C, M, Y, K) = (0.7, 0.5, 0.6, 0.2).
Compute the approximate RGB values corresponding to this colour. Use the simple
RGB-CMYK conversion model discussed in class.

3. (6 points) Local Illumination
Sketch the illumination that would be computed for the following scene using the Phong
illumination model. The scene is viewed from above using an orthographic projection
and is lit by the single light source L. Draw 4 sketches, one for each of ambient, diffuse,
specular, and total illumination.
The Phong illumination model is given by:
I = ka Ia + kd Id (N · L) + ks Is (R · V )n
and the values of the various parameters are:
Ia = Id = Is = 1.0, ka = 0.2, kd = 0.8, ks = 0.7, n = 200.

4. (5 points) Projection matrices
Suppose we wish to perform a projection of 3D points onto the image-plane I, as shown
below. Assume that the plane equation for I is known and is given by
Ax + By + Cz + D = 0.
The center of projection is the origin. Show how to compute the projected point,
P 0 (x, y, z) for any point P (a, b, c). Give the 4 × 4 homogeneous projection matrix that
could be used to perform this transformation.

5. Parametric Curves
(a) (4 points) Derive the basis matrix M for the following cubic parametric curve,
which is specified using two points and two tangent vectors: P0 , T0.2 , T0.8 and P1 .
Use this same order when specifying your geometry vector. Do not bother with
numerically inverting matrices.

(b) (2 points) For a given curve and an efficient implementation, how many floating
point multiplies and additions are needed to compute points on the curve for 1000
different values of t.

6. General Questions
(a) (1 point) Give 3 applications of particle systems.

(b) (1 point) True or False: Decreasing the field of view in a perspective view frustum
will produce a zooming (magnification) effect in the resulting image.

(c) (2 points) Give implicit, explicit, and parametric equations for a circle of radius r
centred at (x0 , y0 ).

(d) (1 point) True or False: Normal vectors can be rotated and translated by using the
same rotation and translation matrices as used for points, but using h = 0 instead
of h = 1.

(e) (4 points) Give the approximate result that would be produced by rendering a black
comb (I = 0) on a white background (I = 1) by applying each of the following
schemes to the following row of pixels. Indicate your sample points on the diagram,
and indicate the final pixel intensity I that would be assigned for each pixel. Make
reasonable assumptions as needed.

(f) (3 points) Describe in general terms how shadows are (or are not) computed using
each of (A) projective rendering with local illumination; (B) radiosity; and (C)
raytracing.

(g) (1 point) True or False: Two BSP trees for the same scene will always produce the
same back-to-front ordering from a given eye viewpoint.

(h) (1 point) True or False: The Phong illumination model can be used to accurately
model the real physical reflection properties of nearly all materials.

(i) (1 point) Ray tracing a scene with only diffuse objects will produce the same resulting image as projective rendering using OpenGL, assuming that the same local
illumination parameters are used. Is this true? Why or why not?

7. (6 points) You are developing a game where the player controls a character that is walking through the forest. The game is played from a “first person” perspective, meaning
that the game player sees what the eyes of the character would see. The character has a
known position Cx , Cy and a known facing angle Ctheta as shown in the figure below. The
game-play is controlled using four keys that make the character take 1m steps forwards
and backwards, and make the character turn left and right in 10 degree increments. The
forest and the animals that inhabit it can be drawn using a call to DrawWorld(), which
draws all the trees and animals in the world according to their world coordinates. There
are moving animals in the forest and they can update their position with a call to the
UpdateWorld() function. The game is written using OpenGL and glut.

Your job is to write the code for the 7 functions given on the following page. You
can assume that the window has already been opened and that the projection matrix
has already been setup. The list of functions that you will need is given below. You
can assume that Cx , Cy , Cθ are available as globals and you can create other globals as
needed.
List of functions:
glClear( GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT )
glLoadIdentity()
glMatrixMode(GL_PROJECTION)
glMatrixMode(GL_MODELVIEW)
glutSwapBuffers()
glTranslatef(x,y,z)
glRotatef(theta,0,0,1)
glutPostRedisplay()
glPushMatrix()
glPopMatrix()
gluLookAt(x_eye, y_eye, z_eye, x_lookat, y_lookat, z_lookat, x_up, y_up, z_up)
DrawWorld()
// draws the world
UpdateWorld()
// updates animal positions in the world
