Question Marks
– You have 110 minutes to write the 13 questions on this examination. A total of 80 marks are available.

1

– You may have as an aide up to 3 textbooks and a 3 inch stack of
paper notes and nothing else. No electronic devices allowed; so,
no cell phones and no calculators.

3

– Keep your answers short. If you run out of space for a question,
you have likely written too much.

– The number in square brackets to the left of the question number
indicates the number of marks allocated for that question. Use
these to help you plan your use of time on the exam.
– Clearly indicate your answer to each problem. If your answer is
not in the provided blank, then indicate where the answer is, and
at the answer’s location indicate the question it addresses.
– Good luck!

[6] 1. Prove or disprove each of the following statements. (Your proof/disproof should be very
brief!)
[3] a. ∀x ∈ Z, (x > 18 ∧ x < 22 ∧ Odd(x)) → Prime(x).
The statement is (circle one):
Proof/Disproof:

TRUE

FALSE

[3] b. ∀x ∈ Z, (x > 2 ∧ x < 6 ∧ Odd(x)) → Prime(x).
The statement is (circle one):
Proof/Disproof:

TRUE

FALSE

[7] 2. Consider the following theorem: Any real number can be added to some real number to
equal 121.
[2] a. Translate this theorem into predicate logic.

[5] b. Prove the theorem. (Your proof should be in the style we have learned in CPSC 121,
though it will likely be brief.)

[3] 3. Move the negation on the following statement “inward” as much as possible. When you’re
done, negation(s) should appear only on predicates—e.g., ∼ M (a, b) or b 6= c—and not on
quantifiers or parenthesized expressions.
∼ ∃a ∈ Z, Foo(a) ∧ (∀b ∈ Z+ , ab < a + b).

[3] 4. Apply the contrapositive equivalence rule to the following statement. Again, in your result,
move all negations inward as much as possible.
∀x ∈ D, (∃y ∈ E, P (x, y) ∧ Q(y)) → R(x).

[8] 5. Let V be the set of voters. Let C be the set of candidates. Let Prefers(v, c1 , c2 ) mean voter
v prefers candidate c1 to candidate c2 . Let Beats(c1 , c2 ) mean candidate c1 beats candidate
c2 in the election. (Do not assume Prefers(v, c, c) or Beats(c, c) is always false for any
voter v and candidate c.)
[4] a. Translate this statement to predicate logic: If every voter prefers one candidate to a
second different candidate, then the second one cannot beat the first in the election.

[4] b. Define a predicate Mid(v, c) meaning voter v prefers some other candidate to c but
also prefers c to some third candidate.

Mid(v, c) ≡

[2] 6. In proving the following theorem with direct proof techniques, you would choose values for
y and z. Which of a, b, and c can y’s and z’s values depend on?
Theorem: ∀a ∈ A, ∀b ∈ B, ∃y ∈ Y, P (a, b, y)∧∀c ∈ C, (Q(y, c) → ∃z ∈ Z, R(b, c, z, y)).
y’s value can depend on: (circle ALL correct answers)

a

b

c

NONE OF THESE

z’s value can depend on: (circle ALL correct answers)

a

b

c

NONE OF THESE

[5] 7. For each of the following theorems, write the letter of EVERY method from the following
list that could be a promising FIRST step in proving the theorem.
List of methods:
(A) Witness proof (constructive/non-constructive proof of existence)
(B) Exhaustive proof.
(C) “Without loss of generality” proof (generalizing from the generic particular)
(D) Antecedent assumption.
(E) Proof by contradiction.
(∀x ∈ D, P (x)) → q
∀z ∈ R+ , ∃y ∈ R, y < z ∧ M (y, z).
∃q ∈ S, K(q)∨ ∼ R(q).
∀x ∈ C, ∀y ∈ D, A(x, y), where C is the set of students in CPSC 121 this term.

[6] 8. For each of the following theorems, indicate the most complete “direct” proof approach—no
proof by contradiction, no use of logical equivalences—that you can by writing the letters
of the techniques from the previous problem in the order you would use them. Ignore any
blanks you don’t need.
So, for a proof that starts as a witness proof, then uses “without loss of generality” twice,
and then antecedent assumption: write A in blank #1, C in blanks #2 and #3, D in blank #4,
and nothing in blank #5.
Theorem: ∀z ∈ Z+ , ∃p ∈ S, Q(z, p).

Theorem: ∀x ∈ Z, (∃y ∈ Z, Froogly(x, y)) → (∃z ∈ Z+ , Froogly(x, z) → x > z).

[4] 9. After a traumatic head injury—received while working as an international logic spy—you
discover the following partial proof on the back of your hand. Write out the theorem the
proof addresses in as much detail as possible.
Without loss of generality, let x be a positive integer. We now consider the
contrapositive of the remaining theorem. Assume R(x) holds. Let y = 5x. We
now show that S(x, y) holds but S(y, x) does not. We proceed by. . . [further
notes obscured by either blood or ketchup]

[4] 10. We used a multiplexer to build a latch, a circuit capable of loading and storing a value.
Consider the following proposed design for a different latch. The latch’s intended semantics
are: (1) When G is 1, the latch loads a new value from D (outputting that value). (2) When
G is 0 the latch stores the negation of the value it loaded from D.

Does this circuit work correctly? Briefly justify your answer.

0000001

[3] b. Clearly and concisely describe the language accepted by this DFA.

[2] c. Fill in the following truth table indicating what the next state of the DFA should be
after receiving an input in state 2. For this and subsequent parts, s0 is the first (leftmost) bit of the state number. s1 is the second (right-most) bit of the state number.

[4] d. Complete the following circuit implementing this DFA. Note that we have implemented circuits for states 0 and 1; you need only complete states 2 and 3.

[2] e. Finally design a circuit that, given the state of the DFA as input, determines whether
the DFA is in an accepting state.

[6] 12. Consider the following sequential circuit that stores an unsigned 3-bit value:

As shown, the circuit stores the number 4, with b0 = 1, b1 = 0, b2 = 0. Complete the
following table indicating what state the circuit will be in for the next three clock ticks. The
table shows how the circuit reached the point where it stores 4, starting from storing 0.
After 0 ticks:
After 1 tick:
After 2 ticks:
After 3 ticks:
After 4 ticks:
After 5 ticks:
After 6 ticks:

[13] 13. Prove the following theorem: If an integer greater than 1 divides two positive integers a and
b, then a and b both divide some integer less than ab (the product of a and b).
Your proof should be in the style we have learned in CPSC 121.
Reminder: p divides q exactly when there is an integer k such that pk = q.
