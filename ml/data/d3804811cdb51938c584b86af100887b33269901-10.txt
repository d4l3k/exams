CPSC 304: MIDTERM ANSWER KEYS
Ques 1. What does the term data independence mean, and why is it an important goal? [4
marks]
Data independence is the layering of a database into abstractions so changes in one layer
will not affect the other layers.
Physical data independence - The ability to modify the physical schema without changing
the logical schema.
Logical data independence - The ability to change the logical schema without changing
applications.
It is an important goal because we don’t want to have to change every single part of the
database when we make a change to only one part. For example if you moved your database
from harddisks to ssds, you don’t want to have to change all your schemas because of this.

Ques 2. Consider the below ER diagram. The ER diagram represents the buying and selling
of the house. Provide answers to the questions based on the diagram [6 Marks]

(a)

If we delete the builder from the database, then what would happen to the houses
that the builder had built? Justify your argument.
All information about these new houses are deleted from the database as well. This
is due to the fact that new house is a weak entity of builder entity and instances of
new house cannot exist without the existence of their strong entity instance. i.e
Builder

1

(b)

If we delete the realtor that sold a house, do we need to delete that house as well?
Why or why not?”
No, because the house is not a weak entity to realtor. In fact, the house entity and
realtor entity participate in a many to many relationships with no participation
constraints. Thus, there could be other realtors that sold the house, or realtor can
just be NULL for the associated house.

Ques 3. Answer the following multiple-choice questions. [3 Marks]
a. Suppose that a1 and a2 are the only entities of A, b1 and b2 are the only entities of B, and c1
and c2 are the only entities of C. Which of the following relationship sets for R and S are possible
according to the diagram, where T = {(e1,f1)} means a relationship between e1 and f1 exists
in relationship set T

A.
B.
C.
D.
E.

R = {}; S = {}
R = {(a1,b1)}, S = {(b2,c2)}
R = {(a1,b1), (a1,b2)}; S = {(b1,c1), (b2,c2)}
R = {(a1, b2)}; S = {(b1,c2), (b2, c1), (b1,c1)}
None of the above

Some other number

a. c. Consider the below table definition, in which numbers denote line numbers. Which of the following
is not a legal addition?
CREATE TABLE Emps (
(1) id INT,
(2) sin INT,
(3) name CHAR(20),
(4) managerID INT );
A. Add PRIMARY KEY before the comma on line (1), add FOREIGN KEY (managerID) REFERENCES
Emps(id) before the ) on line (4).
B. Add PRIMARY KEY before the comma on line (1), add FOREIGN KEY (managerID) REFERENCES
Emps(sin) before the ) on line (4).
C. Add, PRIMARY KEY (id, sin), and FOREIGN KEY (id, sin) REFERENCES Emps(id, sin) before the )
on line (4).
D. All are legal
E. None are legal

Ques 4. Transform the ER diagram into a relational schema. State any assumptions that
you make – but your assumptions cannot contradict the facts given. You only need to show
the schema. (Use underline to show primary key and circle to show foreign key constraints)
[5 Marks]

Primary keys are underlined and foreign keys are bold.
C( G , H, I)
ET( G , J , K)
A( A , B)
B( D , E)
RS( A , D , C, F, G )
Ques 5. Consider the two tables shown below. The TerID column in the SALES_REP relation
is a foreign key referring to the primary key column TerID in the TERRITORY relation.

a. If a DBMS enforces a DELETE CASCADE option on the referential integrity constraint
between SALES_REP and TERRITORY, show the records in tables SALES_REP and
TERRITORY after a user tries to delete the second record (W, West) from TERRITORY.
The record (W, West) from TERRITORY would be deleted. No other records would be
deleted because there are no records in the SALES_REP table with a TerID of W.

4

b. If a DBMS enforces a DELETE RESTRICT option on the referential integrity constraint
between SALES_REP and TERRITORY, show the records in tables SALES_REP and
TERRITORY after a user tries to delete the fourth record (N, North) from TERRITORY.
The record would not be deleted because there are records in the SALES_REP table that
have N as a foreign key.

Ques 6. Midtown Memorial Patients Drug Dispense Database keeps track of the
following information. Create an ER diagram based on the requirements [15
marks].


For each patient it keeps track of a unique patient identifier, patient birthdate,
gender and the patient age which is derived from patient birthdate.



For each nurse it keeps track of a unique nurse ID and the nurse name.



For each ingredient it keeps track of the unique ingredient identifier and the
ingredient name.



For each drug it keeps track of a unique drug ID, the drug name and the drug
coating type.



For each drug intake event by a patient it keeps track of the drug intake event
number (unique within a patient, but different patients could have the same
drug intake event number for their separate drug intake events), the drug
intake event date and the time.



Each ingredient must be contained in at least one drug, but it may be contained
in many drugs. Every drug can contain many ingredients, but they must contain
at least one. For every instance of an ingredient contained in a drug it keeps
track of the dosage of the ingredient in the drug.



Each drug must be included in at least one drug intake event, but it may be
included in many. Each drug intake event must include at least one drug, but it
may include many.



For each instance of a drug included in a drug intake event it keeps track of the
quantity.



Each nurse can administer several drug intake events, but it does not have to
administer any. Each drug intake event must be administered by one nurse.



When a nurse administers the event, a supervisor must supervise her work in
the event. The supervisor can be identified by a name.



Each drug intake event is related to one patient. A patient can have many drug
intake events, but they may not have any.
