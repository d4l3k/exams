Ques 3. Answer the following multiple-choice questions. [3 Marks]
a. Suppose that a1 and a2 are the only entities of A, b1 and b2 are the only entities of B, and c1
and c2 are the only entities of C. Which of the following relationship sets for R and S are possible
according to the diagram, where T = {(e1,f1)} means a relationship between e1 and f1 exists
in relationship set T

A.
B.
C.
D.
E.

R = {}; S = {}
R = {(a1,b1)}, S = {(b2,c2)}
R = {(a1,b1), (a1,b2)}; S = {(b1,c1), (b2,c2)}
R = {(a1, b2)}; S = {(b1,c2), (b2, c1), (b1,c1)}

a. c. Consider the below table definition, in which numbers denote line numbers. Which of the following
is not a legal addition?
CREATE TABLE Emps (
(1) id INT,
(2) sin INT,
(3) name CHAR(20),
(4) managerID INT );
A. Add PRIMARY KEY before the comma on line (1), add FOREIGN KEY (managerID) REFERENCES
Emps(id) before the ) on line (4).
B. Add PRIMARY KEY before the comma on line (1), add FOREIGN KEY (managerID) REFERENCES
Emps(sin) before the ) on line (4).
C. Add, PRIMARY KEY (id, sin), and FOREIGN KEY (id, sin) REFERENCES Emps(id, sin) before the )
on line (4).
D. All are legal
E. None are legal

Ques 4. Transform the ER diagram into a relational schema. State any assumptions that
you make – but your assumptions cannot contradict the facts given. You only need to show
the schema. (Use underline to show primary key and circle to show foreign key constraints)
[5 Marks]

Ques 5. Consider the two tables shown below. The TerID column in the SALES_REP relation
is a foreign key referring to the primary key column TerID in the TERRITORY relation.

a. If a DBMS enforces a DELETE CASCADE option on the referential integrity constraint
between SALES_REP and TERRITORY, show the records in tables SALES_REP and
TERRITORY after a user tries to delete the second record (W, West) from TERRITORY.

7

b. If a DBMS enforces a DELETE RESTRICT option on the referential integrity constraint
between SALES_REP and TERRITORY, show the records in tables SALES_REP and
TERRITORY after a user tries to delete the fourth record (N, North) from TERRITORY.

Ques 6. Midtown Memorial Patients Drug Dispense Database keeps track of the
following information. Create an ER diagram based on the requirements [15
marks].


For each patient it keeps track of a unique patient identifier, patient birthdate,
gender and the patient age which is derived from patient birthdate.



For each nurse it keeps track of a unique nurse ID and the nurse name.



For each ingredient it keeps track of the unique ingredient identifier and the
ingredient name.



For each drug it keeps track of a unique drug ID, the drug name and the drug
coating type.



For each drug intake event by a patient it keeps track of the drug intake event
number (unique within a patient, but different patients could have the same
drug intake event number for their separate drug intake events), the drug
intake event date and the time.



Each ingredient must be contained in at least one drug, but it may be contained
in many drugs. Every drug can contain many ingredients, but they must contain
at least one. For every instance of an ingredient contained in a drug it keeps
track of the dosage of the ingredient in the drug.



Each drug must be included in at least one drug intake event, but it may be
included in many. Each drug intake event must include at least one drug, but it
may include many.



For each instance of a drug included in a drug intake event it keeps track of the
quantity.

8



Each nurse can administer several drug intake events, but it does not have to
administer any. Each drug intake event must be administered by one nurse.



When a nurse administers the event, a supervisor must supervise her work in
the event. The supervisor can be identified by a name.



Each drug intake event is related to one patient. A patient can have many drug
intake events, but they may not have any.

Course (CNo, CName)
Enrolled (StudID,CNo)
where the primary keys are underline. Give an expression in the relational
algebra to express each of the following queries: [9 Marks]

a. List course numbers for which no student is enrolled.

b. List ids of the students who are enrolled in ‘Database’ or ‘Data Mining’ course.

c. List the name of the courses and the student ids in which all ‘COMP’ major
