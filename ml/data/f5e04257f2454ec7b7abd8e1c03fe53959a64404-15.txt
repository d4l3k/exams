– Keep your answers short. If you run out of space for a question,
you have written too much.
– The number in square brackets to the left of the question number
indicates the number of marks allocated for that question. Use
these to help you determine how much time you should spend on
each question.

[12] 1. Short answers
[3] a. When should you use the “guess and test” method to solve a recurrence relation?

[3] b. The Prim-Jarnı́k minimum spanning tree algorithm maintains a value Cost(v) for
each vertex v that is still in the heap. What does this value represent?

[3] c. Does amortized analysis help us design better algorithms and data structures? Explain why or why not.

[3] d. For each positive integer n, there are graphs G with n vertices and Θ(n2 ) edges such
that Kruskal’s algorithm will look at every edge of G, and hence run in Θ(n2 log n)
time. Describe what such a graph might look like.

[8] 2. You have been asked to prove that an arbitrary sequence of n grow and cut operations on
√
a Bosquet data structure runs in O(n n) time. You thus define a potential function Φ,
and then work on computing the amortized costs of the grow and cut operations.
[4] a. The running time of a grow operations is x + 5, where x is the number of trees
involved in the operation (each Bosquet consists of a number of trees). Knowing
that the amortized cost of a grow operation is in O(1), what can you say about the
impact of the grow operation on the Bosquet’s potential?

[4] b. Determine the amortized cost of a cut operation as precisely as possible from the
information given above.

[5] 3. Describe in words a sequence of 2n − 1 operations on a Disjoint Sets data structure such
that a subsequent find operation will run in Θ(log n) time, even if path compression is
used. Hint: start by calling makeSet n times.

[7] 4. Write a recurrence relation that describes the worst-case running time of the following algorithm as a function of n. Note: I do not believe that this algorithm computes anything
useful, so don’t waste any time trying to understand what it does.
Algorithm Elephant(A, first, n)
if n < 3 then
return (A[first] + A[first + n - 1]) / 2
x ← Elephant(A, first + n/3, 2*n/3)
while (n >
n ← n /
x ← x +
first ←
endwhile
return x

1) do

Elephant(A, first, n) * Elephant(A, first + n, n)
first + n/2

[8] 5. Prove an upper bound on the function T (n) defined by


T (n) =

T (3n/4) + T (n/2) + 3T (n/4) + n2
1

if n ≥ 4
if n ≤ 3

Your grade will depend on the quality of the bounds you provide (that is, showing that
T (n) ∈ Ω(1) and T (n) ∈ O(100n ), while true, will not give you many marks).
